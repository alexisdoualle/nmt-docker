Embedded in the legendary landscape of the Yosemite National Park lies the small mountain lake of Tenaya - a crystal clear glacial lake 2484 m above sea level.
The entire region is known for its well-developed tourist infrastructure.
Nature lovers and cyclists find themselves equally happy here.
Specially designed paths, well-developed gravel roads and attractive bike routes invite you to explore the breathtaking nature reserve.
A bike should be well prepared for tougher conditions in urban thickets or the wild:
The lightweight, torsion-resistant aluminium frame with its balanced geometry can easily cope with tours over hill and dale.
Unnecessary weight via additional attachments and a suspension fork were completely dispensed with.
What counts here is functionality and low weight - which is exactly where the Tenaya scores high.
The high-quality Shimano Deore drive with XT gearshift ensures comfortable shifting and low wear.
Combined with Shimano's hydraulic disc brakes and solid attachments, the Tenaya is up to any challenge.
Schwalbe Smart Sam Performance tyres always give the right grip with low rolling resistance on loose surfaces as well as on asphalt.
The Tenaya is a hybrid cross bike for all occasions and impresses with its high-quality and well thought-out equipment.
The simple design of the scooter impresses: it’s extremely light, with an extra wide handlebar, ABEC 11 ball bearings and a concave deck with cutouts.
For maximum brake power, the lightweight brake is made of glass fibre with aluminium reinforcement.
The Mondraker Chrono Carbon R has everything a thoroughbred XC bike needs, but works just as well for daily training on your home tracks.
The modern and aggressive geometry is the same as the Mondrakers podium, it has a long reach that gives you safety and confidence at high speeds and descents.
The Chrono is available in aluminum and carbon, the carbon frame is one of the lightest on the market, 1150g.
All Chrono models feature internal cable routing to enhance the sporty look.
Forward Geometry
Forward Geometry main advantages are an increased safety and confidence riding steep chutes even at high speeds, more reactive, precise and direct handling, more uphill precision and more stability in technical and rough terrain with better grip and improved control overall.
Stealth Carbon
Stealth Carbon’s constantly developing technology brings all the experience gained in making aluminium frames to top of the range carbon fibre to meet the same innovation, maximum quality, minimum weight and strength requirements.

An outstanding mountain bike all-rounder for beginners.
The new edition of the popular "Serious Shoreline 27.5" offers sensational value for money and a complete equipment package that can be used off-road without complaint.
The backbone of the 27.5 inch Shoreline Hardtail is its well-manufactured aluminium frame with neutral riding characteristics and a moderately sporty seating position for off-road tours uphill and downhill.
A Suntour 100mm travel front fork provides optimum control and comfort on dirt roads and narrow trails.
Frame and fork are mounted on sturdy 27.5 inch wheels with wide Schwalbe tyres.
Serious also provides the Shoreline with hydraulic Shimano disc brakes.
High braking power with low hand forces (regardless of weather conditions) keeps the rider cool even on long descents and during spontaneous emergency braking.
Riders can also look forward to steep climbs and fast pedalling passages: the broadly graduated 27-speed Shimano derailleur with Deore rear derailleur offers plenty of bandwidth for everything from pleasure tours to crunchy after-work routes.
Especially with eMTBs, bouncing balls or stone chips, which can seriously damage the deep-seated engine, are part of everyday life.
That's why Haibike was the first manufacturer worldwide to introduce the SkidPlate in 2012, a protective element that effectively protects the engine from below.

BUILT FOR YOU
The R2 is upgradable to any shifting system currently on the market.
You can run tires up to 28 mm wide, for a smoother ride.
And the chain catcher will ensure you won't drop your chain at an inopportune time - like when your friend launches a surprise attack up the hill.
NO WASTED EFFORT
A combination of material, shape, and lay up are used to engineer the desired stiffness of different parts of the frame.
Careful attention is paid to stiffness at the bottom bracket and head tube to create a climbing and descending weapon.
For the R2 Cervélo optimized the stiffness of the head tube, for stable and predictable handling, and the stiffness of the bottom bracket, so that more of your power goes into turning the rear wheel.
FOR A SAFE LEARNING
Specially developed for safe learning with 3 castors, an extra stable, low foot deck and low footrests, the scooter guarantees stability and driving comfort.
The GLOBBER Primo accompanies your child with revolutionary design and highest functionality during the first experiences on wheels.

The 100mm fork and damper suspension is specially designed for lighter riders.
Powered by a Shimano Deore 10-speed drive, the Process 24 is ready for any hooligan.
12x148mm AXLE
12x142mm, 12x148 and 12x157 rear axle standards offer the Kona rider two major advantages:
The 12mm diameter rear axle gives the rear hub and frame a rigid interface, while the 142/148/157mm outer hub diameter allows the wheel to be quickly and correctly positioned in the frame before the rear axle is inserted.
INTERNAL HEADSET
Bearing shells are pressed into the frame and are easily removable.
An internal headset also reduces the stacking height, so that the height of the stem and the bars are better adjustable and the rider gets the best possible fit.
More circumference on the underside of the head tube distributes the shock better, prolongs the headset's bearing life and eliminates brake shock while providing safe steering performance.

QUALITY
Handmade in Europe
A Cube bike with the SL tag has to earn its place in the line-up.
With race-inspired geometry, a super-stiff carbon chassis that still manages to keep the rider comfortable for long days in the saddle, and a full complement of Shimano's utterly gorgeous Ultegra Di2 components for intuitive shifting and powerful braking, the Agree C:62 SL is a state of the art machine capable of transforming every ounce of effort into the pedals into blistering straight-line speed... all day long.
Whether mixing it up in the peloton or hammering out the miles on a summer club training ride, the Agree C:62's raison d'etre can be summed up in two words: maximum velocity.
The Agree C:62 SL's super light race chassis doesn't just look fast, it IS fast.
So, for example, the cutting edge carbon frame comes complete with a matching CSL Evo carbon fork - and both feature attachement points for Direct Mount brakes to improve the bike's aerodynamics and reduce weight as far as possible.
That's because, as with all their bikes, the Cube design team sweated the details.
The integrated seat clamp also looks great, but is also another small detail that makes the Agree C:62 SL more slippery in the air.
Meanwhile the PressFit bottom bracket, tapered head tube and carefully profiled down tube and chainstays build into an incredibly rigid structure that converts pedal input into instantaneous forward progress.
But Cebe hasn't forgotten comfort - because a tired rider is a slower rider.
Slender seatstays combined with a narrow diameter seat post and carbon fork blades mean this is a bike that's as comfortable as it is speedy.
Cube even routed the cables internally to tidy them out of the way and reduce the need for maintenance.
A racing bike - the old dream of many children.
The racing bikes are absolutely suitable for training and competition.
With the S'COOL Race frame made of aluminium specially designed for youngsters, S´cool have found a good compromise between weight and stability.
Ergonomics in all respects.
For example, the shift and brake levers for small hands, which can be operated with little effort, and the straight handlebar make handling easier.
Smooth-running Shimano 18-speed gearbox.
For a riding experience like that of a full-grown bike.
Strongly gripping rim brakes, which can be finely adjusted and thus always provide reliable feedback even on faster descents.
Ergonomics in all aspects.
For example by the shift and brake lever for small hands, which can be operated with little effort.
A shorter toptube brother of the plug in with fat stereo quick up 2.4 tires for massiv tricks and all sealed bearing set up.
More then a decade the speaker plus rushes through the heads of stereo, and like every year Stereo shoots out the perfcet bmx bike which is by far the best speaker plus.
Thats why it listen to matt dark trans barrique.
Newly redisgned specs and updated geometry.
It's an efficient climber, but really blossoms on the descents - especially when it gets tricky.
Actually, the Honzo can't be put in a drawer.
With SRAM 1x11 gears, Vario seat post, RockShox Revelation fork, and WTB i29 rims with Maxxis Minion tubeless ready tires, this bike might end up being the reason when your other bikes get dusty.
Rims compatible with tubeless tyres
Tubeless compatible rims allow tyres with greater puncture resistance, better tyre grip on track, lower rolling resistance and weight savings compared to conventional tube and tyre systems.
12 x 142 mm, 12 x 148 mm and 12 x 157 mm rear axle standards offer two main advantages for Kona riders: the 12 mm diameter of the rear axle ensures maximum stability in the rear hub and frame, while the 142/148/157 mm outer diameter of the hub ensures that the wheel is fast and correctly positioned in the frame before the rear axle can be used.
KONA 6061 ALUMINIUM
Kona 7005 and 6061 aluminum alloys are very strongly represented in mountain bikes and asphalt bicycles.
Kona 7005 and 6061 is a strong, strong and cost effective light alloy that delivers both fantastic and reliable performance over thousands of rides.
Much of the 7005/6061 tubing is butted and/or shaped, which means that the wall thickness of the tubing can be both increased and decreased and shaped, allowing Kona to customize the strength and ride characteristics of a specific frame for fine-tuning a specific application.
SEMI-INTEGRATED HEADSET
The great advantage of an internal headset, where the bearing shells are actually pressed into the frame and are easily removable, is the additional protective layer that protects the bearings from the elements.
An internal headset also reduces the body height, making it easier to adjust the stem and handlebar height for the rider to make the best adjustment.

Steel frame
What has proven itself over such a long period of time in bicycle construction must, of course, also be convincing in terms of the substance: steel offers a high tensile strength in the case of the chrome-molybdenum alloy 25CrMo4 it is over 700 N/mm².
This makes steel the first choice in many sectors of the automotive industry.
The alloy is easy to shape with relatively little energy input and offers good welding properties.
This makes it ideal for producing timeless frames that are filigree and elegant and at the same time highly resilient.
In addition to their toughness, steel frames show an elasticity that offers good ride comfort without the need for a suspension fork or suspension seat post.

Cyclocross can be brutal.
That's why you'll want a bike like this: the magazine test-winning Cross Race C:62 SL.
Featuring a full carbon chassis - complete with cyclocross-specific carbon fork - and a component setup geared for hard use on the race circuit, it's got the low weight, exceptional efficiency and brilliant handling you'll need to stay at the front of the pack.
Cube's design team saved even more weight by speccing Newmen Advanced carbon cockpit components, a Newmen Evolution SL R.32 alloy disc wheelset and Easton superlight crankset.
Then they selected Sram's Force hydraulic disc brakes and Force 1x11 speed transmission, for the ultimate in all-conditions stopping power and slick, reliable gear shifting.
It's a winning combination.
Now all you need to do is pedal, run and pedal your way to the podium.
Cube knows that the simplest solutions can sometimes be the best.
That's why, with the Cross Race C:62 SL's 1x11 transmission, they incorporated a custom chain guide - so you don't have to worry about an unshipped chain ruining your race day.
Featuring modern geometry, the frame, fork and bars also add some 4130 chromoly into the mix and is available in a classic Matte Guinness Black colorway.
Components found on the Gap FC take things up a notch too and are not to be missed.
Not only will it look the part, the 9” Kink Grizzly CC bars, Kink Stryker forks, Kink Bold HRD stem, sealed Mission Deploy freecoaster hub, and Kink Ridge 3-piece tubular chromoly cranks help it to feel and perform the part.
The addition of a Stealth seat and seat post are not to be overlooked either and add both adjustability and modern compatibility.
Modern frame geometry brings a lower bottom bracket and raised standover height to the Gap FC, for a stable ride.
For the rest of the chassis, Cube began with their premium C:62 carbon and crafted it into the lightest, stiffest frame possible - and in five sizes, so that you can find your perfect fit.
The cables are routed internally via the head tube, eliminating cable rub and reducing the need for down tube reinforcement.
The result is a sleeker appearance, shorter cable runs and even lower weight.
With Cube's race-bred geometry providing sharp, nimble handling and the full carbon fork helping to filter out vibration, it's a thoroughbred racer through and through.

It's the perfect symbiosis of ultimate performance, refined aerodynamics and surprising value.
When Cube set out to develop the Aerium Race they had a simple goal in mind: to produce one of the fastest time trial frames currently available.
That's why they equipped the light, stiff Advanced Twin Mold carbon frame with rear-facing horizontal dropouts - just one of the features that contributes to this bike's astonishing torsional and aerodynamic efficiency.
As you'd exepect, the clean lines and internal cable routing aren't just there for looks.
They're primarily intended to reduce air resistance - and Cube proved this by refining the design with the help of wind tunnel testing.
The result is uncompromising performance:
With it's slackened head tube, wide rear tyre, longer wheel base and low centre of gravity, the Classic makes for an incredibly stable bike capable of nurturing the most inexperienced rider.
Whichever way you set up the geometry or seating position, the Aerium C:62 Race will turn every ounce of effort into maximum forward propulsion.

Speaking of confidence, the C3’s top-of-the-line disc brakes deliver exceptional control without sacrificing performance.
The C3’s increased tire clearance, a lower bottom bracket and longer chainstays inspire confidence on mixed surfaces while delivering a longer, more comfortable day in the saddle.
C3 ENGINEERING
Rider confidence can’t be measured in a laboratory or wind tunnel.
The C Series’ more value-conscious endurance model is the perfect fit for serious cyclists looking to get off the asphalt and extend their seasons.
Increasing fork and stack length allows for a more upright riding position and a decrease in stand-over height.
Rather, our engineering team used its profound understanding of pro athletes’ bicycle requirements to skillfully balance performance with ride quality.
Cervélo is renowned for its engineering-driven approach to building the world’s fastest and lightest road, track, triathlon and time-trial bicycles, but the success of the C3 won’t be measured in WorldTour victories or Olympic gold medals.
The C3’s innovative endurance fit is ideal for long, confidence-boosting rides.
A single-piece rear triangle and wide curved seatstays boost back-end and bottom-bracket stiffness, while through-axles improve lateral stiffness in the disc-specific fork.
This bike is stiff where it needs to be, but also comfortingly compliant for those long days in the saddle.
Confidence is also about controlling speed, which is why the C3 incorporates the latest disc-brake technologies, such as the flat-mount standard and through-axles, to enhance safety, drive-train alignment and performance.
Longer chainstays add trail-balance handling at the front end and boost tire clearance to 32mm, providing room for a standard fender and mount.
A downtube rock guard and chainstay protector help prevent potential damage on mixed surfaces, while future-proof internal cable routing delivers smooth shifting every time.

The Cube Aerium C:68 SLT is that bike - utterly uncompromsing in both design and execution.
Developed in conjunction with the aerodynamics specialists at SwissSide, Cube's engineering team began by ditching UCI regulations and setting a new goal: sheer, unadulterated speed.
Built with a similarly uncompromising selection of high end components, there simply isn't a better machine for shaving seconds off your personal bests and improving your race positions.
Using a combination of sophisticated modelling, wind tunnel testing and real world data-logging, the result is a bike that out-performs all its competitors in Cube's tests.
Cube even took into account the need to refuel on the move, designing custom integrated food and hydration compartments that are fully accessible in the aero position.
This bike is ready to race and to win.
Wind is the biggest barrier to higher speed out on the road.
That's why Cube started from scratch with the Aerium C:68 SLT, testing and re-testing different concepts with the SwissSide engineering team until they'd arrived at the fastest, most stable chassis design possible.
The double butted aluminium tubes - thinner where they can be, thicker where they need to be - ensure that the bike is light without compromising stability, strength or safety.
Cube incorporated feedback from pro and amateur athletes alongside their wind tunnel tests, computer modelling and data-logging.
A frame that slices through the air, thanks to its frontal area-reducing dropped seatstays and the unique slotted head tube design.
It's even stable in cross-winds, something that not all aero bikes can claim.
Sophisticated C:68 Twin Mould construction enabled Cube to incorporate food storage and a drinking system, both of which can be accessed without leaving the aero position.
With completely enclosed cables and hydraulic brake hoses, every single detail is there for one purpose only: to help you to go faster.
Immediately after its launch, the Rove became a classic in the Kona range.
Kona 7005 and 6061 aluminium alloys are widely used in our fleet of mountain and asphalt bicycles.

At a little over 5.5 kgs the Belter sets the standard.
It's worth bearing in mind that every kilo on a 3 year olds' bike is the equivalent of 4 or 5 on an adult bike.
At 5kgs lighter than most 16" bikes, that's a big difference to a child.
The high thread count high psi tyres, the cartridge bearing hubs and even bespoke full bearing aluminium pedals all play a part.
But it is the belt drive that steals the show, a belt will never stretch like a chain, it'll never be gunked up by dirt and grease and it will be as good the day your kid has finished with it as the day they first rode it.

AERODYNAMICS - NEW FREEFLOW FORK
The wider fork opening reduces the pressure of the air flow between tyre and fork as well as the resistance by 4 watts.
This new fork meets the new UCI standard and is superior to all competitors in a ratio of 3:1.
This enables the use of a flatter tube, which in turn reduces the air flow at the bottle holders.
DOUBLE RADIUS
This opens the airflow around the tube profile and improves aerodynamics at all angles.
SHORTENED REAR END
FLATTENED SIDES
They reduce the friction at the front of the tube and improve the resistance values at low speeds.
SEAT POST ORCA AERO
The Orca Aero seat post has an oval shape to reduce air turbulence without neglecting vibration damping.
RIGID STRUCTURE
The post is reversible and adjustable by means of a system that, unlike the competition, offers a wider adjustment range for the saddle.
The optimized steering, bottom bracket and strut connections offer improved torsional resistance.
For each wheel size, the cross-sections are optimized to achieve a stiffer structure.

Extra Padding
The Run System Classic scores with its price/performance ratio.
It is a simple and robust adjustment wheel that holds the helmet securely and uncomplicatedly where it belongs: on the head.
The adjustment and fixation of the two straps under the ear plays a decisive role.
The Y-Clip system guarantees millimetre-precise adjustment - in a matter of seconds.
Ergomatic can be operated with one hand - you can loosen the strap uphill, tighten it downhill - and in the event of a fall it is not possible for the locking mechanism to open automatically.
This protects the Hi-EPS and increases the longevity of the helmet.
It covers edges on the underside of the helmet.
At the same time, the neck and shoulder area of the rider is protected against injuries from the helmet in the event of an impact and contact with the lower edge of the helmet.
The strategically sensible arrangement of the ventilation openings is decisive for optimum ventilation of the interior.
The air is directed into the interior, directed along the head and can then flow out again at the rear.
The head is therefore always pleasantly air-conditioned.
The head is therefore always pleasantly air-conditioned.
The material has microscopically small air chambers which absorb the forces acting on the helmet in the event of an impact.
Hi-EPS provides optimum protection and at the same time enables extra-thin wall thicknesses and narrow helmet shapes.
This creates a large-area and inseparable connection between the upper and lower shell.
The helmet is very light and at the same time extremely stable.
A polycarbonate plate is stretched under high heat onto the shape of the later helmet and pressed under high pressure onto the Hi-EPS body and thermally connected to it.

A bike for the hard core - the local heroes, the criterion lap killers, the working class racers with steel legs and the dream of great fame.
A bike for those who know that nothing can come close to a CAAD12 when it comes to pure performance for money.
It's lighter, stiffer and smoother than most carbon frames and not only the best aluminum racing bike ever made, but the only option for those who know.
The aluminium experts
Cannondale's aluminum experts continue to forge ahead with their silver legacy.
The CAAD13's premium SmartForm C1 aluminum is the lightest and most sophisticated aluminum construction on the market.
At the speed of light
The frame is characterized by highly adapted Airfoil tubes, which have up to 30 percent less air resistance than round tubes with comparable weight and the same or even higher stiffness.
Smoother than ever before
CAAD bikes have always been known for their surprisingly high comfort.
The CAAD13 is even more comfortable thanks to the newly designed SAVE rear body, integrated seat clamp and seat post KNØT 27.
Versatile and powerful
The new frame offers room for wide tyres:
30 mm fit easily and open up new dimensions in terms of comfort and traction - no matter how bad the road is.
Fender Up
Fully mudguard compatible.
A removable fender stay between the seat stays is there when you need it and quickly dismantled if not.
Ein Bike für den harten Kern – die Lokalmatadore, die Kriterium-Rundenkiller, die Rennfahrer der Arbeiterklasse mit Beinen aus Stahl und dem Traum vom großen Ruhm.
Ein Bike für die, die wissen, dass nichts an ein CAAD12 herankommt, wenn es um reine Leistung fürs Geld geht.
Es ist leichter, steifer und geschmeidiger als die meisten Carbonrahmen und nicht nur das beste jemals hergestellte Alu-Rennrad, sondern die einzige Option für die, die Bescheid wissen.
A stylish, rugged urban e-bike that turns rush hour traffic into a "what-a-rush!

Cannondale calls the concept XXC:
A flat steering tube angle stabilizes the bike in rough descents, while the steep seat tube angle and extremely stiff chassis ensure efficiency in ascents.
Extreme Cross Country.
Suspension
The Lefty Ocho fork doesn't just look unusual - its interior also works differently than conventional suspension forks.
Its 100 millimetre travel is tightly tuned, like a race bike should be, but it still responds very finely to the slightest unevenness.
In the rear, a pivot-free (and therefore very light and stiff) rear triangle with flexing seat stays in combination with a Fox Float Factory DPS EVOL damper provides 100 millimetres of suspension travel, which can of course be blocked with a lockout.
Gearshift
The first radio circuit for mountain bikes not only ensures an extremely clean look, but also eliminates switching problems caused by extended or dirty trains.
500 % bandwidth through the gigantic cassette is sufficient even for the steepest climbs of world cup tracks.
Wheels
It is clear that the wheels on this bike are also the best the market has to offer:
Enves extremely light M525 carbon rims are hand built in the USA and come with a lifetime warranty not only against production and material defects.
Even if you drive in front of a tree, your rim will be replaced without discussion.
Equipment
Also the rest of the equipment leaves nothing to be desired.
SRAM Level Ultimate brakes and a Enve carbon seatpost are the cherries on the cream cake - this bike is a dream bike through and through!
When choosing the circuit, there could be no other choice than SRAM's revolutionary Eagle XX1 AXS radio circuit.
For ultimate all-round race performance, the SuperSix EVO offers the perfect balance.
Its unparalleled mix of light weight, stiffness, aerodynamics and flex for smooth riding gives you the advantage on any part of the race track that decides victory.
Ultra stiff for explosive acceleration
The asymmetric transition between the PF30 bottom bracket shell and the wider Delta seat tube as well as the special BallisTec carbon lamination ensure great power transmission during sprints.
Breathtakingly smooth - for better cornering, more speed and comfort
The refined SPEED SAVE Micro-Suspension absorbs shocks and keeps your tyres firmly on the road.
For aggressive descents, fast sprints and surprising comfort.
TAP Aero - for consistently more efficiency
Light TAP (Truncated Aero Profile) tube shapes and the placement of the water bottle further down the frame reduce drag by an average of 6 watts/60 grams.
A performance plus in your favour.
Incredible handling
An absolute downhill rocket thanks to its precise geometry and a frame that is stiff yet flexible in all the right places.
The BallisTec carbon construction and system integration design make the EVO incredibly lightweight - yet robust enough.
SYSTEM INTEGRATION
If frame, fork and other key components, such as cranks and seat post, are developed together as a system, several hundred grams of weight can be saved compared to the competition.
Hi-MOD frame weight:
829 grams, fork weight:
280 grams - 67 grams less system weight (frame, fork, headset, seat post) than previous EVO Hi-MOD Disc Frame weight:
360 grams - The disc brake frame set weighs less than 150 grams more than the rim brake version.
777 grams (56 cm, complete).
Fork weight:
SPEED SAVE full carbon fork
Construction with continuous carbon fibers from the drop-out to the top of the head tube provides great structural strength.
The design without fork bearing shells saves weight and optimizes fiber flow for a remarkable STW value.
Lighter, stiffer and smoother than the previous EVO fork.

Incredible traction - no compromise
The patented offset Ai drive provides super short chainstays with traction that lets you take on every climb and offers agile handling.
The best of both worlds: handling &amp; stability
The OutFront steering geometry offers stability for technical descents, but maintains agility everywhere else.
Just what you need on modern Cycloross tracks.
Light as a feather.
Ultra-stiff
BallisTec carbon construction, Si cranks and rear wheels with Ai provide top stiffness and incredibly low weight.
Perfect for the sprint, easy to shoulder.
Massive tyre freedom
The freedom offered by the Ai rear end means you can ride up to 40c wide tyres and dig less into the mud than the competition.
Smooth as a Belgian beer
Newly designed SPEED SAVE features in the fork and rear frame triangle let you steer through rough terrain and save power on hard climbs.
Interchangeable cable guides in the head tube hold the cables securely in place and support any cable configuration.
Super Cross Geometry
Short chainstays for traction and agility, a flat steering angle and a long front centre distance for stability at high speeds and a narrow trail dimension for manoeuvrability at slower speeds.
Removable front derailleur attachment
Spot on for modern XC.

SAVE Plus micro suspension
With their flattened and helical shape, the rear struts offer more flex to absorb shocks and allow the bike to glide smoothly over uneven surfaces.
S.E.R.G.
The 25.4 mm seat post and the seat tube together offer high flexibility and allow more comfort in the saddle.
Geometry
A slightly flatter steering angle, a slightly longer wheelbase and a 2-2.5 cm higher head tube than the Elite Race geometry offer more comfort and stability on all road surfaces while feeling amazingly fast and agile.

Leichte TAP-Rohrformen (Truncated Aero Profile) für Unterrohr, Sitzrohr, Sitzstreben und Gabel reduzieren den Luftwiderstand ohne die Nachteile bezüglich Gewicht, Steifigkeit und Flex der normalen Aero Profile-Rohre in Kauf nehmen zu müssen.
STECKACHSEN
FULL THROTTLE, FLAT-MOUNT BRAKING
But if you ride this bike the way you want it to ride, they're definitely not superfluous.
Flat mount brakes should not be underestimated as a performance feature.
Fewer components, less flexibility, easy to adjust and no unnecessary weight.
So that you can safely put the pedal to the metal.
THRU-AXLE
Size optimized construction
The new Synapse takes the size-specific design philosophy to a whole new level.
Not only are the carbon fiber composite and tube lengths individually designed for each frame size, but Cannondale also use three different steerer and head tube diameters with three different fork recesses to ensure that every rider can enjoy the same ride and handling - regardless of their size.
Racing stiffness
SAVE Micro Damping
Designed to make bumpy surfaces drivable while maintaining direct contact with the road via your tyres, so you can concentrate on the essentials, such as taking the ideal line or getting home faster than the sun.
Endurance Racegeometry
The Endurance Race geometry builds the perfect performance bridge between full racing aggression and the relaxed upright comfort and the relaxed upright comfort of other Endurance bikes.
The name says it all.
The seating position gives you everything you need to ride hard, with exactly the amount of upright posture you need to ride long.
The handling guarantees agile and manoeuvrable riding, but at the same time offers stability and smooth running when it counts.
In short, it's built to perform, not just to endure.

The Hightower brings versatility and brawn to the game hitting a sweet spot between aggressive trail riding and enduro racing.
It sports 135 mm of rear travel and gives you the choice of fast-rolling 29er wheels and a 140 mm fork or extra gription 27.5+ wheels and a 150 mm fork.
The Hightower gives you the extra degree of confidence to let go of the brakes and let 'er rip straightline-style through the rough stuff.
At the same time, it carves incredibly well and is super responsive to steering inputs and weight shifts.
It feels well-balanced in the air and corners like a champ.
As a 29er it's super fast...with the plus tires it's an absolute monster truck.
Climbing is workmanlike - it's great for sit-and-spin efforts and comfortable all-day.
The Hightower LT is designed to meet the needs of the Enduro World Series racing team and is designed for maximum speed in rough terrain.
The 29 is designed for a 150 mm fork.
Longtravelbike bred to achieve pure performance.
The rougher and faster the descent, the more comfortable the bike feels.
From the Chilean Andes in the French Alps, across the pond to the mountains of British Columbia and back to the coast of Finale Ligure, the Hightower LT is the race-ready weapon that the Enduro team chooses for every competition on the hunt for podium places.
The versatile Tallboy climbs uphill almost as fast as a pure cross-country bike.
In downhill, the 110 mm rear travel feels much more like it and creates confidence.
The short-stroke chassis ensures razor-sharp handling.
If there is an XC-Bike for Downhiller, ...
The new 120mm Tallboy makes big jumps again for a short travel bike.
With a strong lower-link VPP rear end, sporty design, Santa Cruz typical finish and a rather radical geometry, the Tallboy is back on track to overcome the limits of bike categories.
Sure, 10mm more travel only sounds like a small change - but in combination with our new VPP suspension (controlled via the lower rocker) this is a big step for the Tallboy.
A bike that only knows full throttle and can sprint at any time - uphill, downhill or in a flat flowtrail.
The maximum efficiency of the VPP rear body ensures pleasantly fast and light-footed handling.
Technically it stands on the same platform as the Longtravel bikes from Santa Cruz and feels comfortable not only in the classic XC terrain, but also on real trails.
Paired with a 130mm fork, the new Tallboy becomes more and more attractive even for aggressive bikers.
The biggest change is in the geometry ...
The dusty theory suggests that small short travel bikes are slower and therefore require steeper and more conservative geometries than their big enduro brothers.
But does that really make sense?
Don't you always want to go full throttle on light trail bikes and enjoy every descent and every trail to the full?&nbsp;&nbsp;
So Santa Cruz sat down and translated their Enduro geometries to Crosscountry.
And a fast bike with little travel and a flat 65.5° steering angle, generous reach and a low offset fork - an aggressive geometry rarely seen in this travel class.
And radical thinking doesn't stop there.&nbsp; The short 430 mm chainstays of the Tallboy have an adjustment option of +/- 10mm so that riders of all sizes and styles feel equally comfortable.
Combined with a relatively low bottom bracket (33,5 mm or 37,5 mm BB-Drop) the Tallboy can be pushed sporty into the neighbourhood and also circulate playfully through demanding trails.
There is (still) no category that fits this bike.
But the name Tallboy says it all - the bike is a fun machine for big boys.
Sure, 10mm more travel only sounds like a small change - but in combination with the new VPP suspension (controlled via the lower rocker) this is a big step for the Tallboy.
Technically it stands on the same platform as Santa Cruz longtravel bikes and therefore feels comfortable not only in the classic XC terrain, but also on real trails.
Coupled with a 130mm fork, the new Tallboy is also becoming more and more attractive for aggressive bikers.
Don't we always want to go full throttle on light trail bikes and enjoy every descent and every trail to the full?&nbsp;&nbsp;
So we sat down and translated the Enduro geometries to Crosscountry.
And we developed a fast bike with little travel and a flat 65.5° steering angle, a generous reach and a fork with a low offset - an aggressive geometry you rarely see in this travel class.
If there is an XC-Bike for Downhiller ...
The thrasher's all-terrain play machine
The 5010 is the most fun you can have on two off-road wheels, and Danny MacAskill’s wee bike of choice.
Turning trails into pumptracks and logs into launches this bike begs to spend as much time above the ground as on it.
A laser sharp, agile trail whip that turns on a dime and loves to pop and play.
The 130mm-travel 5010 sports short chainstays and a low BB for a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, technical climbs.
When it’s time to descend, the bike’s 66.2/66.5-degree head tube angle (adjusted via flip chip) and generous reach/short stem combo equate to precise, confident handling.
This short-travel pocket rocket is packaged to be fast and nimble yet tough enough to take a beating.
From dirt to rocky tech, 4X to BMX, this bike doesn’t give a XXXX what you do with it.
The 5010’s balance and poise takes riders from uncertain neophyte to fledging flyboy.
While some bikes are good at going up and down the 5010 is a bike that’s great at going up, down, left, right, triangle, square, up, up, up and away!
The upper-link driven shock VPP suspension is configured to be sharp and responsive.
A firm beginning stroke makes for a responsive, snappy pedaling and provides support for small bump, bump-jump playfulness, while the progressive curve offers the bottom-out resistance to make it feel like there’s a lot more travel than there actually is.
There’s also more than enough tire clearance to run just about any size tire.
Santa Cruz specs a variety of tire/rim combos, including 2.6-inch tires on Reserve 37 rims because they feel it’s the sweet spot of rock crawling traction and sportiness, but there’s room to run 2.8-inch tires if that’s your thing.
It’s considered the deep cut in the Santa Cruz range by the riders, like Danny MacAskill, who really know.
While people busily overbike, 5010 owners get to the source.
It’s the thrasher’s tool.a
It’s the thrasher’s tool.
Plays every role
Santa Cruz's most notorious thriller.
The Bronson is ready for action no matter what the role.
With the most versatile personality in Santa Cruz's lineup, each version has redefined the expectations of a 150mm bike.
The Bronson can do it all: it hunts at full throttle over every trail and styles with style even over big jumps.
The new damper mount on the lower VPP link opens up greater possibilities for fast shots, good support in the mid-range of travel and a barely perceptible bottom-out.
It's as if we had a set of afterburners bolted to our most powerful all-round bike.
With 150 mm VPP travel on 27.5 wheels, the Bronson rides continuously on the fine line between agility and stability.
160 mm in the front and the 65° steering angle ensure superior handling.
The redesigned, one-piece rear triangle ensures that the rear wheel always stays in the right place, no matter how wild the action.
There's plenty of room to fit up to 2.8-inch tyres on Plus rims.
Santa Cruz offer equipment options for normal 27.5 wheels and Plus tyres with 2.6 width.
For us, these are the perfect compromise between the Velcro-like traction of Plus tyres and the familiar, reliable feel of standard width tyres.
Not to be typecast
Santa Cruz's most notorious thriller, the Bronson, is ready for action no matter what role it's cast into.
The Bronson has the biggest personality in Santa Cruz range.
From flat out on the trail to fully flat over a table, each new generation redefines expectations of what a 150mm bike can do.
The new lower-link mounted shock configuration opens up greater possibilities for maximum bump performance, a supportive mid-stroke, and a barely detectable bottom out.
It’s like Santa Cruz most capable all-around bike just had a set of afterburners bolted on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
With 150mm of VPP travel on 27.5-inch wheels, the Bronson continually rides the sharp edge between agility and stability.
Ideal for negotiating tech-gnar one moment and fast flowing terrain the next, the 160mm fork travel and 65-degree head angle ensure handling remains refined.
Meanwhile, the redesigned, one-piece swingarm keeps the rear wheel tracking on point however twisted you get.
Its versatility makes it the go-to choice for those seeking a skeleton key bike to unlock unfamiliar trails with ease.
Carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon Chameleon...
Santa Cruz have adopted the fun-loving, trail-hungry character and adaptability of the beloved aluminum Chameleon and developed it into a lighter, faster and more advanced species.
It's a do-it-all hardtail that sweeps the nearby hometrails with any playful biker or sets off on a distant bikepacking adventure loaded with full camping gear (and color-matched coffee mug).
Apropos colour-coordinated, the blue Hope hubs and the headset on the SE kit make this reptile unmistakable.
Two bottle holders, including a three-hole holder under the down tube, allow long journeys.
The Carbon Chameleon adapts to its environment.
29 or 27-plus, gearshift or singlespeed:
Due to the different, exchangeable dropouts, the adaptable hardtail mutates from an aggressive trail tiger to a singlespeed racehorse, to a bikepacking loadel or to everything in between.
Depending on the setup and your riding ability, the Chameleon can do almost anything: from fast trail tours to jump lines to all-mountain adventures.&nbsp;
Do you want maximum speed and good roll-over behaviour?
Never the 29.
Do you ride a lot in loose terrain and want grip and comfort above all else?
Get the Plus tyres and enjoy the super traction.
It's the most versatile bike in the Santa Cruz range and can do even more now.
The ultimate power-wheeling, bump-chewing sidekick.
The Megatower is the fusion of big wheels and the biggest-hitting suspension system.
It’s a modern day brawler, as suited to diehard racers as it is to riders wanting to conquer their hometown trails.
The lower-link mounted shock configuration – designed for compatibility with both air and coil shocks – provides a progressive shock rate that has unmatched traction and bottom out resistance, making it ideal for taming the longest descents and rowdiest hits.
A tidy and concealed flip chip in the lower-link adjusts bottom bracket height and changes progressivity of the rear suspension.
A second, in the rear dropouts, allows for a 10mm fore-aft adjustment in chainstay length to dial in the rider’s rearward weight distribution - either set for play or for stability.
In order to make the Megatower stride confidently across the globe it has an enormous amount of clever adjustability hidden in its bones.
The flip chips are a robust mechanism for riders looking to tune their ride according to their needs without compromising reliability and durability.
No wackadoo mousetraps and frail proprietary shocks here.
The Megatower isn’t all fight and fury, it’s smart and savvy too.
It has a sharp, 76-degree seat tube angle for winching to the top of the kinds of descents where having a roomier cockpit and a 65-degree head tube angle will come in handy.
And you can still carry around a full water bottle inside the frame (even with a piggyback shock), and the frame is well protected with a shock fender, shuttle guard, downtube protector and ribbed chainstay protector.
Tracing its roots to the Hightower, and now featuring the lower link-driven VPP suspension derived from the V10, the Megatower is the most capable, confidence-inspiring 29er trail bike in Santa Cruz line-up.
V10 handling at Syndicate speeds
The Nomad's reputation is built on consistently pushing the envelope on how lawless a single-crown bike can get while still remaining a capable daily driver.
The latest iteration nudged the travel and geometry further towards the outer limits, and Santa Cruz surprised themselves at just how well-rounded it turned out.
The fourth generation design saw a dramatic shift to the lower-link mounted shock configuration.
The shock rate is a short-travel version of the V10—which means feather-light small bump sensitivity right off the bat, supportive mid-stroke, and overall progression that you'd normally only experience on a DH bike.
To handle all this newfound capability, the geometry was adapted too.
It's longer and lower-slung to ensure maximum stability and confidence on absolutely everything.
At the same time, the Nomad’s still a trail bike.
It pedals well and tackles valley-to-valley alpine runs and all-day missions without skipping a beat—a fact helped by its pedal-friendly seat tube angle and standard 170mm dropper post fit.&nbsp;
With the Scalpel-Si, you can master the most demanding XC routes without making any compromises.

But why?
What if they looked sexy &amp; sounded like an angel playing a glockenspiel?
A bell with a beautiful tone, but also a remarkable style and choice of materials that embodies a rider’s personality.
In one sense, it's discreet.
But in another, it stands out as unrecognisable.
With a spring-loaded actuator built into the mount, the strike of the bell is firm and fast, allowing a good balance of volume and longevity of sound.
Knog's bell actually has several pitch tones - one core and several supportive higher tones to ensure it's unmistakable and safely heard.
To compare it to a musical instrument, where some bells play a single note, Oi plays a chord.
No worries.
Built into the shape of the mount is a cable management system.
Built into the shape of the mount is a cable management system.
So not only does it allow the bell to look and sound uninterrupted, it also helps gather your cables (for the organiser inside us all).
Again, not a thing.
Just pop it over, give the hex screw a quick tighten up, and you're good to go.
No sliding down the handlebars, no dismantling and re-assembling.
This can be found discretely tucked into the reverse of the grey packaging insert.
Natural evolution progresses in small steps, but bike wear evolution advances in great leaps forward thanks to X-Bionic.
What the human body cannot naturally achieve, these Swiss engineers enable the body to accomplish through a winning combination of innovative spirit and technological perfection.
The result is called X-Bionic Twyce.
The new X-Bionic Twyce Bike Shirt contains 200 % more evaporative surface.
This provides 200 % more cooling of the athlete’s body for the greatest possible boost to performance.
The winner of numerous awards, the patented 3D Bionic Sphere System from X-Bionic is bigger and offers more performance than ever before.
It’s augmented by a complex system of technologies to regulate temperature and optimally transport moisture.
You think you’ve reached the limits of your capabilities?
The gradual release of ions, which are activated by body heat, is the key to the effectiveness of Skin Nodor.
These ions inhibit the growth of microorganisms rather than eliminating them outright, thus preserving the delicate balance of the skin‘s ecosystem.
In other words, Skin Nodor is bacteriostatic (i.e. it inhibits bacterial growth), rather than bactericidal (bacteria-killing).
Therefore, allergic reactions do not occur.
Skin Nodor is especially soft and breathable and provides superior fit.
Reduces the accumulation of germs and bacteria.
Heart rate climbs in order to drive more oxygen into the veins.
So that the body core temperature stays at 37 °C, more blood is demanded by the peripheral blood vessels where it can be cooled by the evaporative process with sweat.
Technical apparel that takes sweat away from the body disturbs the natural cooling effect.
That costs extra energy, instead of assisting the body.
More sweat and more valuable minerals are lost.
That's exactly the problem that X‑Bionic SystemGear effectively prevents whilst also supporting the body in its performance ability.
Information that influences the well-being of the entire body flows past this point.
Warm air enclosed there insulates perfectly in the cold.
The system’s structure processes excess sweat from physical activity and ensures appropriate coolness in the core.
This allows for fresh air circulation for more performance improvement.
Wick perspiration away so it can evaporate using heat dynamics.
A film of perspiration – too thin to be noticeable – is left behind to cool the skin.
Nutritious, organic ingredients.
Performance nutrition.
And great taste.
Whether you’re on a 150-mile bike ride or exploring a new trail, this energy bar is built to sustain your adventure.
The Test Package contains 6 randomly selected Clif Bars.
Not stingy on grip it is ideal for full-suspension trail bikes.
Snappy central knobs and grippy outer knobs provide a maximum grip.
Due to its durable casing and its long-lasting tread it is ideal for sporty amateur riders.
A multitude of small knobs guarantee best traction on any difficult trail.
Thanks to its durable casing and long-lasting tread it is ideal for sporty amateur riders.
It has a versatile and easy-rolling profile which adapts perfectly to any surface.
Thanks to a high-quality, three-layer TubelessReady-enabled casing it provides an excellent puncture protection and thanks to PureGrip Compound an excellent grip and a high mileage.
Taking advantage of it is even better.
The Energizer Summerlight distributes the sweat precisely where it belongs - namely, over a wide surface and directly on the skin.
The body's cooling is optimised, the athlete needs less energy for temperature regulation, and performance ability increases.
If there is no sweat being produced, the action changes.
Insulating air is stored and the systems serves to warm.
Lighter than its big brother, the Bionic Energizer, it still offers the same technology:
Cools when you sweat, and warms when you freeze.
We have no sensors for sweat.
We can only perceive sweat mechanically once drops form and begin to trickle down.
Only at that point do we register “wet”.
Sweat Traps absorb this moisture before it is felt, drawing it away to be evaporated and disposing of it through thermal dynamics.
Only a thin film of moisture remains on the skin.
Cooling is of course not possible without moisture.
You instinctively know this:
When your hands are cold, you put them between your thighs to warm them up, helping you re-establish your overall sense of warmth more quickly.
The Innerlap AirConditioning Zone has been placed in this area.
It is a finely knit fabric mesh with zero insulation.
Cooling therefore occurs initially through the exchange of air.
As soon as sweat has started to evaporate, the cooling process steps it up a notch since the activation system lies directly next to the skin.
More miles, more time, more fun: exactly what you'd expect from a Bosch CX e-bike built by CUBE.

The combination of the Agile Ride Geometry and a low centre of gravity gives this hybrid hardtail handling that'll surprise you - balanced and sure-footed when you need it, agile and lively when you want it.
They've not forgotten practicality, either.
Internally routed cables reduce maintenance and allow for a dropper post upgrade, while the battery can be charged without removing it from the frame.
The result is the Touring Hybrid SL – a Bosch e-bike with the power, build quality, reliability and comfort to take you wherever your adventures lead.
As with all of Cube’s hybrid frames, it's designed around the specific requirements of the Bosch drive unit and battery for the best possible handling.
From the stiff and strong integrated luggage carrier to the air sprung RockShox Paragon Gold suspension fork and wide-ranging Shimano XT transmission, everything is here for a reason.
Sophisticated Di2 electronic shifting works seamlessly with the Bosch control unit for flawless shifting and smooth power delivery, while the included lighting set is powered by the Bosch battery so that you can be seen on the road, whatever the time of day.
Powerful Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes deliver safe, assured stopping in all weather conditions.
Finishing touches like the full length mudguards and kickstand mean you've everything you need, whatever the occasion.
Whether you're looking for the ultimate weekday commuter or an inspirational weekender, the Touring Hybrid SL fits the bill.
What's more, the Men's and Trapeze versions feature a custom-designed cover over the battery for a neat, integrated look.
Revised Efficient Comfort Geometry gives the Touring Hybrid SL sharp responses while maintaining its reputation for implacable stability, whatever the road conditions.
This stability is given a helping hand by the integrated rack which provides the lightest, strongest and most rigid possible support for carrying whatever load you need to transport from A to B... whether that's a briefcase or camping equipment.
Cube even used their Smooth Welding technology to clean up the frame's appearance, giving the impression that one tube almost flows into the next.
That, and the internal cable routing, are just the kind of attention to detail that you'd expect from Cube.
Enjoy the ride.

A kit bag essential, it's great choice for regular training or leisure swimming and helps protect your hair from chlorine.
For more than a decade X-Bionic has been developing technology that supports the human body in a targeted way.
The knee - a joint always under stress - offered a particular challenge.
In order to further optimise power transmission and the life of the pedal, this surface is made of stainless steel and is shaped into the pedal body.
This is due to the use of composites that allow weight savings without affecting resistance.
Composite body, INOX contact surface, oversize axle and double density make this pedal a particularly safe and durable product.
It consists of 2 miniature ball bearings (12 mm inside x 18 mm outside) and a needle bearing.
LOOK axles are only released after a rotational test of 1 million cycles at 100 rpm with a load of 90 kg on the centre of the pedal and an eccentric rotation (one shock at each revolution).
This test exceeds the highest applicable standard in this area:
EN standard EN14781.
He is the undisputed number one worldwide for fixie riders, messengers, urban bikers - now also on the German-speaking market.

DuraSkin makes the side wall impermeable.
With the Gatorskin you have a lot of fun, because the PolyX Breaker protects under the tread.
Gatorskin's the right tyre for the road.
The Gatorskin is the perfect choice when it comes to tough performance in urban terrain.
Polyester has been successfully used in car tires for years and has proven itself many times over.
The extremely resistant polyester fibre is tightly woven crosswise.
This results in a very high fabric density, which makes the breaker not only resistant to foreign bodies, but also particularly resistant to punctures.
The rolling resistance is also not negatively affected by the PolyX Breaker.
They are used under the most adverse conditions.
On messenger bikes the tires slide along kerbs, on touring bikes they cross continents without scratching through, in racing they have to pass toughness tests like Paris-Roubaix.
The high-quality polyamide fabric reliably protects the sidewall of the tyre and prepares the tyre for the extreme.
These tyres stand out from the crowd thanks to their brown sidewall.
This sporty bikini is made of soft chlorine-resistant fabric.
The top ties behind the neck and back for a personalised fit.
The X-Socks Bike Racing model is especially lightweight and is cut lower than X-socks other biking models.
The lightweight finish provides optimal contact from the foot via the shoe to the pedal, ensuring excellent control and optimal transmission of power.
A complex system of padding reduces pressure in exactly those areas where shocks and friction are greatest, effectively diminishing the risk of sustaining pressure points and skin abrasions.
The climate-controlling materials and the “Air” ventilation system create a dry, climatized, and temperature-controlled environment for your feet, even under extreme conditions.
It begins there and then moves along the foot up to the cuff.
Covering only 30 % of the skin’s surface, it is constructed using a fine-knit mesh, so with every step, moist air is pumped out of the shoe and fresh air is drawn back in. An optimal air circulation system for the foot is now a reality: fresh air can even be circulated within a snug-fitting shoe.
This is why X-Socks invented the X-Cross Bandage.
It is a cross ankle bandage knitted from an elastic material, which stabilises the ankle and optimally supports the foot’s function without limiting the freedom of movement.
One careless step can be enough to destroy this experienced team.
The crescent-moon-shaped alignment of the pads offers the best possible protection without affecting the ventilation ability of the AirCondtioning Channel.
Therefore the ankles require extra protection without inhibiting the foot’s freedom.
The integration of the control panel with Bluetooth module in the top tube will please the young target group just as much as the free Kalkhoff Display App: a smartphone connection provides navigation and infotainment at bike computer level.

The Kathmandu Hybrid SL is ready for anything.
Meanwhile, powerful hydraulic disc brakes - with the extra reassurance of a four piston caliper up front - give you the stopping power to bring you safely to a halt in any weather conditions.
All you need to do is jump on and ride.
Luckily, our engineering team is up for the challenge.
Using experience gained from working on our sleek MTB hybrids, they found a way to fully enclose both drive unit and battery within the frame's down tube.
This creates the basis for superbly efficient power delivery, keeps the weight low for improved handling and has the added bonus of giving the Kathmandu Hybrid SL incredibly sleek looks.
The integrated rack is the latest incarnation of our simple, strong and elegant load-carrying solution, while a tapered head tube helps deliver precise, confidence-inspiring steering.
Add internally routed cables for clean looks and reduced maintenance, and you're looking at our best urban e-bike frame to date.

Thanks to the combination of cushioning zones and ventilation channels, these socks are particularly good for middle and long-distance runs.
The cushioning on the instep and on the heel dissipates the impact and shockwaves that are created with every step you take.
The patented Lambertz-Nicholson Achilles Tendon Protector envelops the sensitive tendons in a recessed area which functions as a support to protect against the risk of chafing and abrasions from the top of the shoe.
The integrated ventilation channels of the Traverse AirFlow Channel Systems on the soles and the AirCool Stripes on the instep continue to let fresh air circulate freely in the shoe.
This shockabsorbing cushion serves as a buffer between foot and shoe and thus prevents pressure and friction.
Moist, warm air can escape upwards out of the shoe.
The foot remains dry and resists blisters.
Run with them.
Thanks to its combination of padded zones and ventilation channels, this sock is particularly suitable for medium and long distance races.
The cushions on the instep and heel divert the shocks and shock waves that occur with every strong step from the foot.

If our designers had anything to do with it, every CUBE would be designed and equipped this way.
With its streamlined looks, integrated battery and a full complement of range-topping components, the Elite Hybrid C:62 SLT is the powerful, lightweight Bosch e-bike to beat.
Brand new Shimano XTR component highlights include a carbon crank, silent freehub and four piston hydraulic disc brakes front and rear.
Throw in an unparalleled 1x12 gear range of 10-51 teeth and the fact that the transmission and Bosch components integrate seamlessly for smooth shifting, and it's hard to argue with the fact that we think this is the ultimate e-MTB setup.
Newmen carbon cockpit components and Evolution rim complement the plush, easily adjustable Fox 34 Float Factory fork, and the whole lot rolls on grippy, big volume Schwalbe Nobby Nic tyres for the ultimate in grip.
If you're thinking that all this reads more like a wish-list than a spec sheet, you'd be right.
But then, that's what you get when you tell the CUBE design team not to spare any expense: e-perfection in carbon form.
All of that knowledge and experience has been poured into the Elite Hybrid C:62 SLT's chassis.
The result is a lightweight, rigid frame built from our premium C:62 carbon using our Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing technique.
With a low centre of gravity, surprisingly low weight and an efficient design - aided and abetted by the 12mm Boost rear axle, oversize down tube and tapered head tube - it's got handling that'll surprise you.
Our Agile Ride Geometry delivers on-trail poise and ability that makes the most of this bike's peerless pedigree so that you can ride further, faster.
Bosch's PowerTube battery lives inside the down tube under its own sealed cover, but it can be recharged without removing it from the frame.

Cables run internally to complement the elegant looks, and we've even allowed for an easy dropper post upgrade.
The devil is, as we've always maintained, in the detail.
If there's a faster, more inspirational e-MTB, we're not aware of it...

What sets Electra apart from the pack is the patented Flat Foot Technology.
Available on most models and new this year on all 16" Kids’ bikes.
The 16" Lotus1 Bright Pink for Girls is the Mini-Version of the famous Electra Townie Original.
While the little ones will definitely like the cool designs, parents will appreciate the level of quality found in adult-sized bikes.
Without ever riding one, the difference is often underestimated.
Characteristic are the particularly upright and relaxed sitting position with complete leg extension when pedalling as well as the possibility to place the foot completely on the ground when stopping without having to get off the saddle.
The latter and the fact that the very upright sitting position provides a good overview of what is happening in the direction of travel are also safety-relevant advantages.
The weather is great, you’ve got all day and you’re riding Terra, so keep the wheels rolling.
If route-finding, taking the long way home and straying from the beaten path are your ideas of fun, there is no better tool than Terra for unlocking your desire to explore.

1190 G. The perfect blend of low weight and durability for a long life of fun.
E-bikes are not only good for the environment but especially on short distances up to 10 km the fastest of all means of transport.
Space for different tyre widths and the possibility to attach accessories such as mudguards means that the Terra can adapt to the application due to its allroad geometry.
And what's best: the annoying search for a parking space is also a thing of the past.
The new Yakun models offer an optimal balance of manoeuvrability and rolling characteristics for every terrain.
And their powerful Yamaha engine unfolds its strength especially when starting off and on the mountain.
The careful examination and revision of all components has eliminated as far as possible the discrepancies that can occur in the interaction between rider and bicycle.
The result is a drive that is more powerful than before and has such a natural ride support characteristic that you don't even notice it when riding.
Yamaha has significantly reduced the total weight by 380 grams by using a hollow axle shaft, a thinner driven wheel and a thinner housing wall and by reducing the volume by almost 13%.
In EXPW mode, the drive makes better use of engine power thanks to significantly improved cooling.

These were Cube's thoughts when they set out to build the Newroad WS - a bike that will allow you to keep riding where other road bikes fear to tread.
Nimble, adaptable and rugged enough to take tarmac, gravel, mud and just about any surface you care to mention in its stride, it'll open your eyes to new possibilities.
With a purpose-designed aluminium frame and carbon bladed fork, there's ample clearance to run up to 40 mm width tyres for superb grip, comfort and control - Cube chose Schwalbe's G-One Allround tyres for their great perforance.
Shimano's reliable Tiagra 10 speed transmission puts the gear you need for any eventuality right at your fingertips, and Tektro Spyre disc brakes offer ample all-weather stopping power.
They did, however, have a lot of experience building great race and cyclocross bikes.
Figuring that this would be a great place to start, Cube combined the best of both genres to create the new, super-adaptable all-rounder.
So, for example, the Nuroad WS's geometry is based on the comfort, stability and agility of the Attain WS series.
Cube made sure there's plenty of clearance to run wide, grippy and comfortable tyres up to 40 mm width, and even left room for mudguards too.
Kids will love their first real riding experiences with this model.

Schwalbe uses a highly modern and extremely precise mixing technology for the Addix compound, which is otherwise not used in the bicycle tyre industry.
All parameters of the mixing process can be varied almost without limit.
The Bullet Bike can be ridden anywhere without registration, driving licence or age limit.
The range in everyday use (incl. inclines, medium support) is 70 km. The developers of the Bullet Bikes don't believe in unrealistic conditions.
It can therefore be ridden without a driving licence, without registration and without age restrictions.
It is legally equal to the bicycle.
The Bullet Bike is the first pedelec that combines unique design and functionality.
Let's face it, today's design hasn't changed dramatically since the first folding bike.
And yet there are always revolutionary innovations.
The N-Fold technology is one of these: it ensures that folding is even faster and, above all, more compact.
The new frame and stem geometries allow the front wheel and handlebar/stem unit to "move outwards" during the folding process, so that the length of the folded model is 40 mm shorter than before.
This means that the folding dimensions of the 24" Eclipse and Castro models differ only slightly from the models with 20" wheels.
This saves space and is even faster with N-fold folding technology.
That's why Tern developed the Andros stem, which can be adjusted not only in width but also in height.
The patented TwinStem design can be unlocked quickly and easily using a lock.
No matter if sporty-stretched, comfortable or especially upright, every position is possible and practical.
Thanks to its construction, the Andros stem is one of the most stable and rigid adjustable stems currently on the market.

It's also as light as reasonably possible, thanks to a curved and formed down tube designed specifically to suit a young rider's weight.
And with components colour-coordinated to match the frame, every Access rider is sure to love their new ride.
The unique front rack is very practical - meaning you can keep your eyes on your precious bag at all times.
This trusty bicycle is equipped with high-end LED dynamo powered front and rear lights for road safety in low light and all-weather.
The Echo Solo Lady is built around a lugged mixte frame with cromoly front triangle for fine handling and great looks.
It features a 16 speed drive-train with reliable components, and you will find some nice touches such as polished rims and a classic 1” quill stem.
This bike is the ideal choice for anyone who want's to get a first taste of how good road cycling can be, or simply for cruising around town.
A trail-ready hardtail with an extra dose of attitude, it's got everything you need to push your trail riding to the next level.
With 2.6in tyres and an X-Fusion RC 32 fork with thru axle and 130mm travel, you can tell right away that this is a bike that means business.
The Newmen cockpit with 760 mm handlebar gives you the confidence and control you need, while powerful new Shimano MT400 hydraulic disc brakes ensure you can always scrub off speed when you need to.
A Race Face Ride crankset transmits power to the rear wheel via Shimano's reliable, slick-shifting Deore 1x10 speed transmission, and we even fitted a dropper post so that you're ready for those pulse-quickening line choices.
Bring it on, because the Reaction TM is ready.
The Reaction TM's rear thru axle, tapered head tube and complex profile, hydroformed main frame tubes give it the rigidity it needs to pedal efficiently and steer accurately.
All that torsional rigidity means, of course, that it's great at making forward progress.
Triple butting shaves weight where it isn't needed, so none of the Reaction TM's trail-shredding ability comes at the expense of excess weight.
And to improve comfort, the slender seat stays and 27.2 mm seatpost help take some of the sting out of the trail, so you can ride for longer.
Cube even routed cables internally, so your gears shift cleanly without the need for regular tweaking and fiddling.
Well, okay, maybe three things: speed, comfort and versatility.
Stealth dropper post compatibility means you can upgrade without spoiling the Reaction Race's clean lines, for example.
With a buttery smooth RockShox Judy fork featuring black stanchions, powerful hydraulic disc brakes and Sram's wide-ranging 1x12 Eagle GX transmission, the Reaction Race is all set to take on whatever you care to throw its way.
It's a bike that feels as good out on the trail as it does on the race course or city streets... what can be called a winning formula.
It features double butted, mechanically formed aluminium tubes for efficient power transfer and accurate steering, backed up by the PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube with integrated sealed bearings.
It boasts internal cable routing, so your gear shifts stay cleaner for longer, even in filthy trail conditions - and there's provision for a Stealth dropper post, too.
And, with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry, you can be sure of the inspirationally stable-but-lively ride quality for which all Cube bikes are justifiably famed.
The distinctive livery is fair warning to your startline competition:
This is a bike that means business.
Starting with a frame constructed from their very best C:68 carbon, Cube went on to spec the best of the best in high end components.
Shimano's brand new 1x12 XTR transmission combines the marque's legendary smoothness and precision with the widest possible range of ratios to cover any eventuality, while a Fox fork offers superb adjustability, impeccable bump swallowing ability and low weight.
Topped off with Newmen carbon cockpit components and Schwalbe rubber for the best grip and cushioning, it's all uncompromisingly high quality.
Are you ready to smash out a few more personal bests?
Because the Elite C:68 SL teamline most definitely is.
It's all down to its cutting edge carbon frame construction, with a desgin that makes use of all the latest carbon technology including Cube's high end C:68 fibre and Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing.
All the must-have features are here: tapered head tube with integrated carbon bearing shells, PressFit bottom bracket shell, 12 mm through axle and low maintenance internal cable routing.
On, and that comfort?
It's thanks to a 27,2 mm seatpost and careful positioning of the rear brake caliper on the chainstay, which allowed Cube's designers to incorporate narrow, vibration-absorbing seatstays.
Cube take care of the clever stuff.
All you have to do is put the hammer down and race.
Cycling is not only one of the most beautiful things in the world, it also means freedom - especially for children.
Who doesn't remember this feeling of simply being able to start off, cycle to the neighbour and set off for adventures?
Children deserve a safe, reliable bike to have fun and learn quickly.
Ghost's Powerkids are just that - loyal companions perfect for discovering the world.
The Kids series includes the right model for all body heights (and colour preferences): from the 24-inch bikes with Shimano parts, suspension fork and 160 mm disc brakes to the Minis, the cute 12-inch Powerkids, for the first attempts at pedaling and the Powerkiddy balance bikes.
The aluminum frame has all the fender and rack mounts you could need to load up and stay dry for the day-to-day commute, and the Acera drivetrain with its bevy of gears can handle the load.
The Tektro hydraulic brakes make stopping at any moment a confidence-inspiring occasion.
Fat-tyre adventures begin with a bike that you can rely on - a companion that'll be with you over every pebble, rock and root, no matter where you explore.
Cube built the Aim with this in mind, using their expertise in aluminium frame building to create a bike with a comfortable ride and intuitive, safe handling.
Reliable components include a Suntour suspension fork and powerful mechanical disc brakes.
And with Cube's Size Split system, there's a frame size to suit every rider.
Safe, predictable handling is the backbone of any bike.
The result is a bike that'll inspire you to explore, wherever the trail leads you.
New for 2019, they've refined the frame design so that fitting fenders or a rack is quicker, easier, neater and more secure.
That's why Cube started with their renowned compact Agile Ride Geometry, for a perfect blend of lively handling and a relaxed, comfortable ride position.
To make sure all your effort is translated into forward progress, Cube added a cross-ovalised down tube for extra stiffness, made from 6061 aluminium using their Advanced Mechanical Forming process.
For 2019 Cube also redesigned the rear triangle, incoporating new rack and fender mounts to make a conversion into an all-round commuter or tourer quick, easy and incredibly neat.
The whole lot is as light and strong as you'd expect from Cube - it's passed their rigorous in-house testing in Cube's purpose-designed lab - and is finished off with several layers of paint in a simple but bold colour scheme, to keep it looking good for years to come.
Ready to serve you all year round - no matter the place you live in. But don’t take its kindness as a weakness.
Ready to serve you all year round - no matter the place you live in. But don’t take its kindness as a weakness.
Flip the chip in the fork and suddenly you’re not dealing with good, old Mr Ed, but a pure blood Arabian!
Geometry, aerodynamics, responsiveness and weight were on the top of the list of priorities.
Fender friendly steel workhorse booted with wide road tires and equipped with disc brakes.
Then they added some of the best value, best performing components they could lay our hands on.
The RockShox Judy Gold - with stealth black stanchions - offers easily adjustable, super-plush comfort and control.
Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with a 180 mm front rotor mean you'll always be in control no matter how steep, fast or technical the trail becomes.
And Cube finished off this speed machine with Sram's peerless GX Eagle 1x12 transmission: simple, light and incredibly versatile.
Rolling on smooth, light and strong Answer Atac wheels, it all adds up to a potent combination for getting as quickly as possible from A to B, off-road.
The result is incredibly responsive tracking and steering, combined with startlingly quick acceleration.
Combined with the Agile Ride Geometry, it gives the kind of ride quality and handling that keen riders will love.
Slim seatstays and a 27.2mm seatpost help take some of the buzz out of the trail for great comfort - good news if you like to ride not just hard, but long too.
Cube reduced weight as far as possible through the use of a PressFit bottom bracket and integrated, sealed headset bearings.
The cables are routed internally, partly to maintain the frame's good looks and partly so that you can be assured of long-lasting smooth gear shifting.
There's even provision for a later upgrade to a Stealth dropper post.
All that's left to do... is pedal.
Fun, safe and versatile - that's the Ella 200 in a nutshell.
Based around an easy entry frame, Cube has added smooth-rolling tyres and a host of add-on accessories to create a bike that's perfect for adventurous youngsters, wherever their riding takes them.
The LED lighting system - driven from a hub dynamo, so you never have any worries about batteries running out - is permanently 'on' and built to withstand any weather conditions, so young riders will always be visible to other road users.
The brake levers are designed to fit small hands perfectly, and there's a power modulator on the front brake so that over-enthusiastic use doesn't lead to sudden over-the-bars dismount, or worse.
Shimano's 7 speed gear system is easy to use and reliable, giving little legs the range they need to tackle most hills.
Carrying belongings is easy thanks to the included cargo rack, while full length mudguards help keep clothes dry even when the road is wet.
The Ella 200 doesn't even need a wall, tree or fence to stay upright - Cube took care of that with a built-in kickstand.
All that's missing is a young, keen rider.
There's a replaceable gear hanger, so that a knock or mishap needn't result in an expensive repair, and the handling is designed to flatter a young rider's developing skills with just the right blend of stability and agility.
Built to handle the rough-and-tumble of everyday use and with the assurance of having passed Cube's tough in-house safety tests, their design team is as proud of these little bikes as they are of any that they create.
Cube's engineers wouldn't settle for anything less.
Based around their durable Kid 200 mountain bike frame, Cube has added smooth-rolling tyres and a host of add-on accessories to create a bike that's perfect for adventurous youngsters, wherever their riding takes them.
The Kid 200 Street doesn't even need a wall, tree or fence to stay upright - Cube took care of that with a built-in kickstand.

The Elite C:68 SLT is more than just a race bike, it's an exceptionally light, astonishingly stiff and incredibly rapid cross-country machine.
For 2019 we've equipped it with Sram's standard-setting XX1 1x12 groupset with an all-new carbon crankset.
From the Fox Float Factory Stepcast fork to the range-topping Newmen cockpit components, we simply picked the best of the best and left it at that.
Even the DT Swiss wheelset is carbon, giving this ultralight race bike a uniquely high-tech appeal that translates, very simply, into blistering performance.
We set it up with everything we could think of to leverage maximum speed.
So there's a tapered head tube with carbon bearing shells, a PressFit bottom bracket and 12mm through axle at the rear for maximum steering precision and instant power transfer.
The chainstay-mounted rear brake caliper allows the use of slender, vibration-absorbing seatstays - so you can stay comfortable and kepp the power down for longer.
There's even provision to fit an internally routed dropper post, should you wish to upgrade in the future.
Our engineers live by a simple motto: the devil really is in the detail.
With its light, stiff and responsive frame - built from Cube's premium C:62 carbon - and a selection of components that won't let you down, it's the best way of ensuring that other riders only ever get to see your rear wheel disappearing into the distance.
There's a full Shimano XT 2x11 transmission with matching hydraulic disc brakes for precise shifting and powerful stopping, Race Face Next R carbon cranks for efficient power transfer, a Fox 32 Float fork to keep the front wheel planted and tracking straight, a lightweight Fulcrum wheelset shod with grippy Schwalbe tyres and a light, strong Newmen cockpit.
All this premium kit is there for one reason, and one reason only: so that you get on with the job of leading from the front.
The Reaction C:62 SL ticks all those boxes.
Crafted from Cube's premium C:62 carbon, it boasts race-inpsired geometry built around a short, Boost axle-equipped rear end for exceptional drivetrain rigidity.
Cube added an integrated headset and PressFit bottom bracket to maximise weight savings, and tweaked the acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry for the best combination of speed and stability.
The result is a light, stiff, incredibly responsive race frame that translates every ounce of your effort into instant forward progress.
By selecting a slender 27,2 mm seatpost and speccing narrow seastays, Cube's engineers ensured that all this efficiency doesn't come at the expense of rider comfort - even longer rides and races won't leave you feeling beaten up.
It's the little details that make all the difference...
As you'd expect, cables are routed internally for long-lasting clean shifts and reduced maintenance, and there's even cable routing for a future Stealth dropper post upgrade.
If you've been looking for the best in lightweight, race-bred hardtails, your search is over.
With its light, agile and responsive C:62 carbon frameset and uncompromising component selection, the Reaction C:62 SLT is the bike to head up your wish-list.
Refined frame details and responsive geometry work in harmony with Sram's precise Eagle 1x12 transmission and powerful hydraulic disc brakes, a RockShox SID air fork and a light, stiff and strong Newmen wheelset.
It all adds up to blisteringly quick performance, race after race, ride after ride.
It all adds up to blisteringly quick performance, race after race, ride after ride.
Whether you're chasing your ride buddies or another podium, the Reaction C:62 SLT won't let you down.
Beginning with their own premium C:62 carbon, CUBE’s designers crafted a frame for the Reaction SLT that perfectly blends form and function.
For example, the Boost rear end, PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube work together to deliver exceptional torsional rigidity.
That means more accurate steering and more efficient power transfer.
But the slender 27.2 mm seatpost and skinny seatstays also help take some of the sting out of the trail, resulting in lower rider fatigue - which means you can ride faster, for longer.
Internal cable routing keeps gear shifting clean and precise in even the worst conditions, and the whole lot is designed around CUBE’s acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry for ride-by-wire handling.
All you need to do... is pedal.
And furthermore, Laufey is the origin of Orbea´s so far most versatile and smartest bike:
The Laufey has created a new riding style!
Instead of saying that the Laufey is only tailored to a specific type of rider, Orbea developers go one step further and claim that this fun-loving model is simply perfect for everyone.
These height and length measurements are relatively coherent and thus guarantee perfect handling of an elegant, fun and fast wheel for all riders, regardless of frame and tyre size.
Many of the tubes are compressed in the middle, far away from the stresses of the welds and joints, in order to achieve a weight reduction.
The aluminium technology is as advanced as the carbon production, which is why the Alubikes are always among the best.
BOOST
The increased rear axle length from 142 mm to 148 mm allows the chain to be moved outwards by 3 mm, allowing more space at the pedal crank.
Orbea's patented Digit seat post, on the other hand, is significantly lighter and faster to adjust the height of the saddle while driving by means of a short stop.
The same frame gives you a choice of 27+ or 29" tyres.
The 27+ are wider than conventional tyres and have a much higher volume, which is why they require less pressure.
This means that the Plus tires go further than their rivals, even in mud, snow and sand, on virtually any terrain.
It’s the ease of knowing your suspension is dialed.
It’s a boost of confidence, speed and control when a bit more of any could make a winning formula.
It’s a boost of confidence, speed and control when a bit more of any could make a winning formula.
With a SRAM 1x11 drivetrain, dropper post, RockShox Revelation fork, and WTB i29 rims with tubeless-ready Maxxis Minions, this bike could end up being the reason your other bikes gather dust.
It’s an efficient climber, yet truly shines on the descents – especially when things get twisty.
It’s the difference between the tentative first go of the year and the ripping third lap of a midsummer day.
Enduralin is the extra bit of fun that turns a good ride into a great one – the shouting of the crowd, a flow state of euphoria, cowbells, chainsaws, accelerated reaction time and enhanced perception.
It’s the difference between a Good Time and All-Time.
That’s the simplicity of the Paddy Wagon.
A durable and zippy 4130 cromoly frame, flat handlebar, and your choice of single speed or fixed gear.
The Paddy Wagon proves that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
With the kids bikes from Electra your kids can do, too.

Here comes the Aim Allroad - a versatile all-rounder that'll slot neatly into your life.
From weekend offroad adventures to the daily commute, its combination of mountain bike ruggedness and urban practicality is tough to beat.
Clip-on mudguards, built-in lighting system and a Cube kickstand are the perfect setup for city streets, while the Suntour suspension fork, wide-ranging gears and powerful mechanical disc brakes are all you need to keep riding when the Tarmac stops.
Cube has even refined the rack and guard mounting system for 2019, so you can add a luggage carrier quickly, easily and incredibly unobtrusively.
Is this bike the best of both worlds?
Cube has designed it for this purpose.
And because it's available with Cube's Size Split system, you're sure to be able to find the perfect fit for you.
Internal cable routing keeps gear shifting smooth, reduces maintenance and looks great too.
Advanced Mechanical Forming allows Cube's engineers to make a stiff, light, cross-ovalised down tube for maximum efficiency and precise steering.
Rack mounts - completely redesigned for 2019 - make it easy to add luggage carrying to the list of the Aim Allroad's capabilities.
And, of course, Cube used their renowned Agile Ride Geometry to creat a bike that's stable when you need it and inspiring when you want it.
Topped off with several layers of paint to keep it looking good for years to come, it's a bike you can be proud of.
Who doesn't remember the feeling of being able to just kick off, explore the neighbourhood and go on adventures?
Children deserve a safe, reliable bike to have fun and learn quickly on.
The Ghost Powerkids are exactly that:
With 2×11 groupset (can be changed to a single chain ring if required), our people’s bike for the park.
Orbea don't have to gather a long pedigree, because two World Championships are sufficient proof that the Oiz is a real thoroughbred.
Oiz is synonymous with true cross-country, which is why his presence at the World Cup is omnipresent.
The Oiz is one of the lightest, stiffest and most powerful bikes on the market, whether you want to take part in a competition or just take a ride.
The Oiz has what you need:
There's no better weapon to aim for the top.
The rear shock absorber lock developed by Orbea itself is completely invisible and therefore does not get dirty and does not interfere with the grip on the water bottle.
All controls are more accessible and user-friendly, resulting in a damper design that is the most attractive and sexy on the market.
It's only a small detail, but when the whole wheel is optimized and personalized, even the smallest detail becomes very important.
Fiberlink is seamlessly integrated into the frame and seat tube.
WORLD CUP GEOMETRY
The posture is aggressive, comfortable and fast.
The handling is precise and intuitive to ensure maximum agility without loss of stability.
All angles and dimensions have been carefully studied for greater fun and efficiency.
You will appreciate the results of this complicated, careful process.
The prepreg sheets made of pre-impregnated carbon are laser-cut to minimize excess material before optimum compaction with the smallest amount of material is achieved through a lengthy preforming process.
The development of a frame that uses as much carbon as possible naturally leads to a weight saving, but also contributes to the refinement and perfection of the Oiz.
Features such as "UFO 2" and "Fiberlink" fully exploit the advantages of carbon and make the Oiz a class of its own.
The frame sizes M, L and XL offer two water bottle holders in the front triangle.
The additional space achieved thanks to the internal cables allows water to be stored near the hands instead of in pockets or at the back.
And yet the technologically innovative aluminium hardtails embody the authentic mountain bike spirit.
Optimized for small races with friends, side trips to the trails on your doorstep, long routes, lots of laughter and lots of nature, they are the perfect bikes for MTB beginners and offer pure mountain biking!
The light and stiff aluminium frame with 27.5" or 29" wheels, suspension fork, hydraulic disc brakes and a wide range of drives is fun for everyone.
Every MX convinces by balanced and versatile driving characteristics and last but not least a cool look.
Long-term driving pleasure is guaranteed with an Orbea MX.
And with the 827 carbon WME with 1×11 XO1, a front mech can be fitted thanks to the supplied DualPlate to create a double chain ring drive.
These models all have the option to change the suspension from 170 millimetres to 160 millimetres of travel.
Performance and practicality don't have to be mutually exclusive.
With Cube's Aim SL Allroad they took all the good things about their range-topping, affordable hardtail - great handling, a 9-speed Shimano transmission and comfortable suspension fork - and added mudguards, a luggage carrier, Cube kickstand and an integrated lighting system.
Newly redesigned rack and mudguard mounting points mean that these practical, essential accessories integrate seamlessly into the frame's svelte looks, making it perfectly suited to the urban jungle.
The easily configurable suspension fork, powerful hydraulic disc brakes and dynamo-powered lights add up to a bike that'll take on any challenge, on road or off.
And Cube's Size Split system means there's the perfect frame and wheel combination for you, whatever your size and shape.
That's why Cube's engineers designed complex profile top and down tubes, made using their Advanced Mechanical Forming process out of 6061 aluminium.
They combine to make a lightweight, rigid backbone for precise steering and effortless acceleration, while the Agile Ride Geometry ensures a ride that's stable when you need it and inspiringly nimble when you want it.
New for 2019, the rack and mudguard mounting points have also been reworked.
With internally routed cables for cleaner gear shifts and reduced maintenance, it's all part of the attention to detail that makes the Aim SL Allroad a compelling blend of comfort, liveliness and practicality.
It boasts all the features of a 'real' mountain bike because, quite rightly, that's what a keen young rider would expect.
So there's a Suntour suspension fork, to improve comfort and control on rough surfaces.
Cube fitted a Shimano 7 speed gear system with Velo grip controls to bring every hill, up or down, within reach.
The V-Brakes are powerful and easy to control, thanks to levers that are specially designed for small hands and a power modulator on the front.
And, of course, the heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame is built with the same attention to detail as every Cube bike.
With a bike like this, there's nothing standing in the way of off-road adventures for your little riders...
The result is a frame that's every bit as durable as a full-size mountain bike, but with the right weight and proportions for a child.

With its strong 6061 aluminium frame and light aluminium fork, Cube has made a virtue out of simplicity.
The smooth-shifting Shimano 7 speed gears give your youngsters the range they need to keep up with the grown-ups, while powerful V-Brakes - fitted with a power modulator at the front to minimise the risk of accidents - are equipped with brake levers especially designed for small hands.
New width Schwalbe tyres are lighter than before as well as grippy, fast-rolling and comfortable and, of course, the whole thing is designed and built with the same attention to detail that Cube put into all their bikes.
And, because accidents will happen, Cube has made the derailleur hanger easily replaceable so that a knock or crash needn't result in an expensive repair.
Sometimes less really is more.
The Acid 200 SL takes the same successul formula at the Acid 200, and trims what little fat there already was to result in an even lighter bike that your kids are going to love.
There's the same easy-shifting Shimano 7 speed transmission with extra large 36 tooth bailout gear, for those times when tired legs need some extra help.
The lightweight aluminium frame and fork saves grammes wherever possible, so it's livelier to ride than its competitors.
Cube chose brake levers that are specially designed to work properly with smaller hands, so your child is always in control of their ride.
And the brakes themselves?
Simple, light and strong V-Brakes for plenty of stopping power and super-easy maintenance and adjustment.
All your child needs.
Because accidents can happen when they're pushing their limits, Cube has made the derailleur hanger easily replaceable so that a crash doesn't write off the frame.
It's the little touches that make all the difference...
Built on a steel frame and fork, it can be set up as fixed gear bike or in single speed mode.
If you want cover longer distances you have to check out the rag+. short for road and gravel, the 'plus' is there because you can run it with standard standard gravel tires (up to 45c) or even 27.5” mtb wheels with tires as big as 2.2”! perfect for anyone who want’s a real drop-bar all-rounder.
The range of applications is unlimited - from commuting to cx racing and anything in between - this bike really is an absolute hit.
With features like the complex profile down tube borrowed from our adult range, you can be sure that this is a real mountain bike... just in miniature form.
An alumumium fork complements the frame perfectly, and we've carefully selected the components to provide a comfortable fit and perfect function for young riders.
From new width CUBE tyres to the brake levers designed for small hands, we've taken care of all the details.
A singlespeed setup means all that's needed is to get on and pedal, while a Hebie Chainlooper encloses the chain and keeps it away from your youngster's legs.
Kids may be small, but they're capable of giving a bike frame a really hard time simply through their enthusiasm, energy and the process of learning by making mistakes.
The Cubie 180 takes its cue from its adult counterparts, blending lightweight aluminium tubes into a stiff, svelte and strong structure that's built to take everyday knocks and scrapes in its stride.
There's plenty of clearance for our new CUBE tyres, and we've fitted V brake bosses front and rear so your child can learn how to control their speed with proper, 'grown-up' brakes.
It's every inch a real mountain bike, just stripped down to the bare essentials.
The Attention is the kind of bike that'll redefine your expectations.

Building on this ergonomic foundation, Cube selected components renowned for their performance and value.
New for 2019, they have even redesigned the rear end to make it easier than ever to attach a luggage carrrier and mudguards for a sleek, integrated look and the added versatility of a day-to-day commuter or weekend tourer.
With a Shimano 3x10 speed transmission - including an XT rear derailleur - and a smooth, easily adjustable RockShox suspension fork, Cube has created a versatile hardtail that'll slot right into your active lifestyle.
Details like the integrated rear disc mount and elegant rack and mudguard mounting points simply reinforce the fact that this is a serious bike, built to do its job well.
And with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry, the Attention offers just the right blend of stability and agility to take on any riding challenge, regardless of whether you're on the road or off it.
Cube designed the ride position to be both comfortable and efficient, so you can get on with racking up the miles... and smiles.
With its sporty geometry and fat (but fast!) tires you can charge across the city, hopping over curbs, not giving a f*&amp;c about potholes or the condition of the pavements.
The flat bar gives you tons of control, and the Twintip fork will let you adjust the attitude of the bike to suits your preference - lower, more twitchy, or higher and more stable.
One of the coolest features of the bike is the carbon belt drivetrain which needs to be used on a daily basis to be fully appreciated.
Quite, completely clean and service free.
Simply fantastic.
This position gives the bike a higher frontend, slacker head angle and longer trail and space for big tires and / or fenders.

The slender 27,2 mm seatpost and seatstays ensure that even longer races and rides aren't an uncomfortable chore, and internal cable routing means that every time you go for a gear you'll find it, even in the muddiest of trail conditions.
The whole lot is wrapped up with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry for the optimum blend of liveliness and stability.
Front and rear lights, a wicker basket (woven in Poland) that is easy to remove, and a maintenance free 3 speed hub are all standard features that will make your journey better.
This is the right one for you.

Starting with the proven performance of CUBE's sleek, light and unfailingly rapid C:62 carbon cross-country frame, the design team assembled a veritable wish-list of components.
Shimano's brand new XTR 1x12 transmission tops the bill, serving up an incredibly wide range of perfectly-spaced ratios with the shifting accuracy and smoothness that you'd expect from Shimano's range-topping groupset.
Matching XTR brakes offer the same level of performance for scrubbing off speed, while Shimano MT900 hubs are laced to light, strong Newmen rims.
The Newmen cockpit features a carbon handlebar and seatpost for even more weight savings, and the Fox 32 Stepcast fork keeps the front wheel firmly planted on the ground, so you're always in full control.
If you're thinking by now that the Reaction C:62 ONE sounds like a cross-country racer's dream bike, that's probably because it is.
Stop dreaming, and chase down that podium.
Its unique properties are harnessed in the Reaction C:62 ONE through a combination of clever design, the use of the premium C:62 carbon material, and the ability to finely control the production process via twin mold technology.
The massive cross-section down tube, tapered head tube and Boost thru-axle rear end work together to created a supremely efficient platform for translating pedalling input into rapid forward progress.
Meanwhile, the narrow seatstays and 27.2 mm seatpost help take the sting out of the trail, so you can ride harder for longer.
Are you?
It's ready to race.
Internally routed cables ensure that gear shifts at the end of a muddy race are as clean and precise as they were at the start, with the bonus that you can spend your time racing and training rather than fiddling with your gears.
Light, stiff, responsive and built for one purpose only - to go as fast as possible from A to B. To that end, Cube has poured all their accumulated carbon frame building experience into it.
Featuring fast-rolling 29er wheels, the Reaction frame makes use of Cube's C:62 carbon layup and features neat design touches like a Boost 148 rear axle and Stealth dropper post cable routing.
Kitted out with a smooth, easily adjustable RockShox air fork, Cube-built wheelset and a slick, reliable Shimano SLX and XT 2x11 transmission, it's missing just one vital component: you.
Cube's design team began with short chainstays and Boost thru axle at the rear, and a tapered head tube up front.
Seriously impressive power transfer, steering and overall responsiveness thanks to the Agile Ride Geometry.
Cube hasn't forgotten comfort, though - the slender 27,2 mm seatpost and slim seatstays work together to help take the sting out of the trail, so you can go harder for longer.
Internal cable routing maintains the frame's sleek looks as well as clean gear shifting, and Cube made sure that an upgrade to a Stealth dropper post is easy.
With a PressFit bottom bracket and integrated headset, Cube has ensured the entire chassis is as light as they could make it.
Less, after all, is more.
Less weight means more speed...
Less weight means more speed...
To Cube’s designers, this means one thing: they can really go to town.
The combination of RockShox's new Sektor fork and 2.6 in Kenda Hellkat and Nevegal 2 tyres serves up a serious dose of technical trail-taming ability, backed up by the Kind Shock LEV dropper post - so you can tackle steeps with ease - and a Newmen cockpit with 760 mm handlebar for superb control.
With powerful hydraulic disc brakes to keep your speed in check and Sram's 1x11 NX transmission with a Race Face Ride crankset, you've everything you need to take the fight to the mountain... and come out on top.
That's why Cube threw all their aluminium frame building know-how at the Reaction TM Pro, starting with a triple butted, hydroformed tubeset for the best combination of low weight and exceptional strength.
The tapered head tube, carefully crafted main tube profiles and Boost thru axle at the rear create a torsionally stiff structure that transmits all your effort to the rear wheel - whilst ensuring steering so accurate, it's almost as though the Reaction TM Pro is directly linked to your brain.
Internal cable routing complements the frame's svelte looks and means you can spend your time riding, not fiddling with your gears.
And Cube didn't forget comfort, either.
Those slim seat stays and the slender 27.2 mm seatpost are there for a reason: they help take the edge off the big hits, so long days in the saddle are a pleasure rather than a pain.
Perfect for the ride to school, trips to the swimming pool or first small tours on the weekend.
Ghost aimed for a hardtail that was fun, safe and easy to ride.
The fact that racing doesn't stand at the concept's center is demonstrated by the 130 mm suspension travel or the 27.5-inch wheels' plus size tyres.
It steers through the rough terrain with comfort, grip and confidence.
You'll find a Roket which is optimally equipped for your kind of riding.
Though it only has 110 mm of travel it feels like more and is super confidence-inspiring.
Its short-travel chassis gives it scalpel-like handling with great airability.

Quadric Dropouts
Dropouts are often overlooked, but a good dropout goes a long way.
Our Quadric dropout is built taller, so your disc brakes are protected inside the frame.
We even included a mount for a sturdy rear kickstand.
The design makes the eyelets for mudguards, racks, and our clip system more user-friendly and accessible than ever before.
Magnetix 2.0
The Magnetix 2.0 uses powerful magnets to keep your bike folded for situations like carrying your bike up and down stairs.
With a pull force 10-15 Kgf, the Magnetix 2.0 will keep your bike folded even when being jostled and moved about.
Physis 3D Handlepost
Five patented technologies and unique manufacturing technology add up to the strongest, stiffest folding handlepost available.
The Physis uses a special manufacturing process called 3D forging, which forms the post from a single piece of aluminum, eliminating all welds.
To keep the weight down, the frame is built using cromoly tubes.
The bike is equipped with some great parts such as the San Marco Rolls leather saddle, hand polished high profile rims, sealed bearing Novatec hubs and classy cold forged cranks.
Tasty Dia Compe stainless steel cable guides are included so that you can have elegant routing when using brakes, or you can remove them and leave the frame completely clean when the bike is being used brakeless.
The Vinyl Uno is built around a steel frame and fork.
It's simple, reliable and practical.
You will find some nice touches such as high profile rims and a beautifully finished cockpit with a 1” quill stem.
Removable cable guides mean that the frame remains totally clean and uninterrupted in brakeless mode.
An optinal derailleur hanger is available so you can convert this bike from single speed to gears if needed.
In the case of the Reaction SL it's your guarantee of a bike that'll transform any ride into a motion-blurred celebration of speed.

Shimano's peerless XT 2x11 transmission has the range to get you up any climb, and matching hydraulic disc brakes with a 180mm front rotor ensure you have the power at your fingertips to keep your speed under control on the way back down.
It's ready to rock.
Mechanically formed, double butted 6061 aluminium tubes for low weight and superb acceleration and control?
Check.
Fully integrated, sealed bearing headset for long life, installed in a tapered head tube for accurate steering?
Present and correct.
Internal cable routing for all cables including a future upgrade to a Stealth dropper post?
Of course.
Put it all together with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry for ride-by-wire nimbleness and it's a winning formula whether you're racing, going to work or just riding for fun.
As usual, the range splits into three categories - the most hardcore model is the Eccentric Alu which now rolls on big 2.5” rubber.
The beautiful Eccentric Cromo is the perfect all rounder that will be appreciated by steel frame lovers whereas the Eccentric Lite is in our opinion the one most fun trail hardtails on the market.
This bike is Ghost DNA in pure form.
Extremely light, extremely stiff - and of course extremely fast!
This bike was developed for competition, regardless of whether you are competing against the international competition or you want to fight a new PB on your training session:
The LECTOR pushes you to your limits!
And, of course, the race genes are also reflected in the looks:
The provocatively stylish mixture of angular shapes, smooth transitions and a clean look through completely interior-installed lines is a clear speed statement.
The Reaction TM Race, that's what.
Combining prodigious rock-swallowing ability with light weight and a turn of speed that may surprise you, it's the instrument of choice for discerning techncial singletrack afficionados.
The Fox 34 Rhythm Sweep fork - poised, accomplished and perfectly capable of swallowing rocks whole and reducing them to the size of pebbles - is just the start.
A Kind Shock LEV remote dropper post puts adventurous lines within easier reach, while Newmen cockpit components keep you in control, aided and abetted by Magura's MT Trail Custom hydraulic disc brakes and Kenda Hellkat and Nevegal 2.6 in tyres.
Forward propulsion, meanwhile, is taken care of by Sram's wide-ranging, slick and accurate NX Eagle 1x12 groupset.
You couldn't ask for a better partner in crime for tackling your favourite trails.
Bring it on, because the Reaction TM Race is ready to rock.
Triple butted, hydroformed tubes allow Cube’s engineering team to finesse weight savings wherever possible, whilst ensuring that the resulting chassis is stiff, strong and built to last.
Accurate steering is assured thanks to a combination of the Boost thru axle, complex profile down tube and tapered head tube - good to know when you're navigating a trail full of boulders at speed.
Internal cable routing keeps mud, water and grit out of your gear cables so you can spend your time riding, rather than wrenching.
But don't think that this is some kind of uncompromising bruiser - Cube built in all-day ride comfort with the slender 27.2 mm seatpost and deliberately slimmed-down seatstays, specifically so that you can shred 'til sundown.
What's the result if man's and machine's forces unite?
The Hybrid Lector Line doesn't deny its race genes - on the contrary, it enhances performance!
For all sports-minded e-bikers who value exclusivity, elegance and a true cross country attitude.
It really gets down to business!
It really gets down to business!
Here comes the Acid 200 Allroad - with all the cool factor of a real mountain bike, but with all the safety features that parents want for peace of mind.
Cube started with the proven versatility of their Acid 200, because it's such a capable junior off-roader.
With child-specific V brakes that are specially adapted for small hands and 7 smooth-shifting gears, it's got everything the budding off-road adventurer needs.
There's even a power modulator on the front brake to prevent a sudden handful from resulting in an unscheduled dismount... and tears.
Additionally there's a pair of high quality LED lights powered by a hub dynamo - so there are no batteries to run out - and a pair of snap-on mudguards.
There's no better way of introducing young riders to the joys of exploring by bike, and you'll be safe in the knowledge that this is a bike that'll allow their skills to develop... off-road or on.
That's why the Acid 200 Allroad features a heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame that's every bit as well made as its grown-up counterparts.
Light, strong and durable, it's the ideal foundation on which to build your child's riding skills.
The derailleur hanger is easily replaceable, so little mishaps needn't result in expensive damage.
And, of course, when the engineers had finished their job Cube's design team took over and made the Acid 200 Allroad look entirely awesome...
Here comes to introduce the Access 200 Allroad - with all the cool factor of a real mountain bike, but with all the safety features that parents want for peace of mind.
Cube started with the proven versatility of their Access 200, because it's such a capable junior off-roader.
Then there's a pair of high quality LED lights powered by a hub dynamo - so there are no batteries to run out - and a pair of snap-on mudguards.
And, of course, when the engineers had finished their job Cube's design team took over and made the Access 200 Allroad look entirely awesome...
That's why the Access 200 Allroad features a heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame that's every bit as well made as its grown-up counterparts.
Anyone who occasionally to regularly goes riding in the mountains and wants a reliable, easy-to-hand while lively all-rounder and who does not place much value on a specific performance characteristic.
And with the 727, the playful aspect is considerably more pronounced than with the other trail and Enduro lines.
The Kid 240 in action team grey is the deal choice for growing riders who want to keep up with their friends and parents.
Cube gave it all the features of a 'real' mountain bike because, quite rightly, that's what a keen young rider would expect.
Cube fitted a Shimano 3x7 speed gear system with Velo grip controls to bring every hill, up or down, within reach.
And, of course, the heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame is built with the same attention to detail that Cube lavish on every bike that they make.
An enclosed chain keeps transmission grime and moving parts away from little legs, while the rear mudguard's cool motocross-inspired looks help reduce splatter from the rear wheel.
New Cube tyres offer plenty of grip, a comfortable ride and all the rugged looks of a full size mountain bike, but in a compact package.
The simplicity of a coaster rear brake, combined with a smooth rim brake controlled by a lever tailored for small hands at the front, means your child can learn how to control their speed as their confidence grows.
Cube selected sensibly proportioned, child-friendly components that are designed to last the course, so you can rest assured that the rough and tumble of learning to ride won't result in broken dreams.
And, because that accidents will happen, the rear derailleur hanger is easily replaceable so that a knock or crash needn't result in an expensive repair.
The geometry is tailored to the needs of young Cube riders, so it's stable and easily controllable, with a low top tube to improve confidence and safety.
Sturdy and lightweight 6061 aluminium tubes build into a structure that's tough enough to stand up to enthusiastic use, but light enough not to be off-putting.
Smooth edges and corners wherever possible help minimise the risk of injury, and a choice of paint finishes means there's a Kid 160 that'll capture every child's imagination.
Smooth edges and corners wherever possible help minimise the risk of injury, and a choice of paint finishes means there's a Cubie 160 that'll capture every child's imagination.
Smooth edges and corners wherever possible help minimise the risk of injury, and a choice of paint finishes means there's a Cubie 160 that'll capture every child's imagination..
Borrowing inspiration and ideas from Cube's high end race bikes, their designers selected a RockShox air sprung fork for the ultimate in easy adjustability and smooth, progressive bump swallowing performance.
They added powerful hydraulic disc brakes and a 180mm front rotor for assured stopping in all conditions, and finished off with Shimano's slick-shifting and reliable Deore and XT 2x10 gears.
It's all bolted to Cube's light, agile, comfortable and adaptable 6061 aluminium chassis - and, because of Cube's Size Split setup, there's an Attention SL to suit every rider.
Cube's design team sweated the details on this frame every bit as much as they do on their pro athlete bikes, right down to redesigning the rack and mudguard mounting system for 2019 to make a touring or commuting setup even easier to add. Everything from the internal cable routing to the integrated disc mount is designed to improve function without adding unnecessary weight.
Multilayer paint means it'll take everyday knocks and scrapes in its stride without losing its good looks.
And, as you'd expect from Cube, their Agile Ride Geometry means the Attention SL has the same poised, balanced yet agile handling that you'd expect from any Cube bike.
The "20" in the name stands for the frame size and the "9" for the large number of gears.
The slightly profiled 20-inch tyres provide sufficient traction on different surfaces.
The model also comes with road-ready accessories including front and rear lights, all necessary reflectors, mudguards and bell.
A stable aluminium frame and suspension fork ensure long-lasting riding pleasure.
Wide 20-inch tyres allow you to comfortably cruise through the city.
In addition, this model comes with top accessories - including front and rear lights, all necessary reflectors and mudguards.
If it's still dark on the way to school in the morning, young riders can rely on their hub dynamo powered front and rear lights.
This 26 inch bike is equipped with a suspension fork that helps riders get from A-B comfortably - even on less than great cycle paths.
Youngsters from 145 cm and up will have a lot of fun with this bike - which has rim brakes at the front and rear as well as a 7-speed Tourney system.
If it is still dark on the way to school in the morning, they can rely on their hub dynamo powered front and rear lights.
Children over 120 cm tall will enjoy  this bike - which has rim brakes at the front and rear as well as a 3-speed Nexus hub gear system.
So they started with the same frame that they use for the Reaction Pro: light, nimble, stiff and with some really neat design touches.
Then they added a RockShox Recon fork, for easy adjustability, accurate steering and superb comfort and control.
And finished with Shimano's peerless XT transmission and hydraulic disc brakes, which continue to set the gold standard for reliability and performance.
You're going to love the result.
The Race ONE lives up to its name.
What do you need in a great-handling, versatile hardtail?
Well, it needs to be light and stiff for starters.
Well, it needs to be light and stiff for starters.
That's why Cube began with mechanically-formed, double butted 6061 aluminium main frame tubes combined with a tapered head tube.
Taken together they form a rigid backbone for the rest of the frame, carefully tailored with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry to build a chassis that's responsive and accurate.
Then they took a close look at the luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points, making them even neater than before so that you can add the accessories you need easily and, just as importantly, without ruining the clean lines of your bike.
Details, see?
They're what make a Cube.
With the Acid 200 Disc, now they can.
Featuring hydraulic disc brakes front and rear and an easy-shifting Shimano 7 speed gear setup, it's got everything the aspiring junior mountain biker could wish for.
Brake levers designed especially for smaller hands ensure that your child can learn to brake safely, while the large 36 t bailout gear provides some extra help for tired legs on long or steep climbs.
It's all wrapped up with a lightweight aluminium frame and fork, designed with the same care and attention to detail that Cube lavish on all their frames.
With new Cube tyres and a colour scheme that coordinates the frame, wheels and components, it's all your child needs to expand their horizons.
And, just like a real mountain bike, there are neat disc mounts front and rear.
And you'd be right.
Completely revised for 2019, Cube has retained all the features that made the Reaction a popular choice amongst keen riders and added sleek, easy-to-use luggage carrier and mudguard mounts for even more versatility.
The spec list is bursting with high quality components that won't let you down.
From the easy adjustability and plush performance of the RockShox air fork to the slick reliability of Shimano's 2x11 SLX and XT transmission, this is a bike that's crying out for some fast singletrack action.
No-compromise speed, comfort and control, and now with the option of an easy conversion to commuting or touring duties.
It's a compelling combination.
So for 2019 they kept all the best features - like the mechanically-formed, double butted 6061 aluminium main frame tubes - and added a dose of real-world practicality with Cube's new, super-sleek luggage carrier and mudguard mounting system.
It's a little touch that means a conversion to commuter duties or weekend touring is quick, easy and elegant.
There's still a stiffness-enhancing tapered head tube with integrated headset, as you'd expect.
It's all put together with Cube's Agile Ride Geometry, for the best possible blend of comfort, pace and agility.

This is still continuing, not least because the backpack has proven itself for school and work use as well as on excursions and trips.
The backpack is made of durable, lightweight Vinylon F, which repels dirt and moisture.
Thanks to the large zip opening, the spacious main compartment is easy to pack.
The two flat side compartments and the zippered front compartment are ideal for everything you need to get to hand quickly when you're on the go.
When not in use, the PE foam seat cushion disappears in the rear inner compartment, where it prevents the contents of the backpack from pressing through to the back.
As soon as you want to take a break, it's easy to take out.
The simple yet practical carrying system consists of handles on the top and narrow, adjustable shoulder straps.
The logo on the front is reflective.
Inside the main compartment there is an address label.
Vinylon F
Vinylon F requires no coating.
By absorbing moisture better than any other synthetic fibre, Vinylon F swells like a natural fibre and fills the spaces in the fabric.
The fabric is therefore waterproof due to its structure, which makes a coating superfluous.
The result is a lighter and more durable material.
In addition, Vinylon F has a high abrasion resistance, which ensures that it proves its durability and functionality year after year.
G-1000 Original
Durable and adaptable material from Fjällräven.
The dense fabric is wind- and water-repellent and very robust, yet extremely breathable and quick-drying.
The wax gives the material additional protection against dirt, wind and moisture and can be applied thicker or washed out as required.
Apart from wind and weather, G-1000 also protects against harmful sun rays and annoying insect bites.
The compact StVZO lighting set with a 12 Lux LED front light can be easily attached to the handlebar without tools.
The holder can be swivelled by 60°.
The light is removable and can also be used as a flashlight.
The Tour taillight stands out due to its slim design and can be universally mounted.
The tail light can be mounted on the seat post or seat brace without tools.
Both lights are supplied with holder and batteries.
The lights can be mounted without tools and are splash-proof.
Ideal for use in cold weather.
Thermolite uses fibres that are hollow inside to create an insulating layer of warm air.
The result is a light, warm fabric with outstanding transport properties for water vapour, which does not become heavy even when wet.
Thermolite developed by Endura also benefits from a durable, water-repellent Teflon treatment (from Dupont).
The water-repellent technology High Performance Repel TEFLON fabric protector ensures that textiles do not absorb liquids.
TEFLON is a registered trademark of DuPont used by Endura Ltd. under a license agreement.
Care instructions:
This stocking is made of very dense Merino blended fabric and has a high heat/weight ratio, even in wet conditions.
Very easy to clean and machine washable, additional padded toes for more comfort.

It promotes the psychomotor development of children and can be driven indoors and outdoors.
"PUKYMOTO" is an ergonomically designed children's vehicle that closes the gap between a four-wheeled sliding vehicle and a two-wheeled running wheel.
PUKYMOTO enables children who are already able to walk safely to drive more dynamically and sportively than with a classic sliding vehicle and offers more tipping stability than with a wheel.
All of us want to get to work and arrive back home relaxed.
​
My first PUKY
All PUKY balance bikes are designed so that small children who can already sit or walk can move intuitively with them and develop their motor skills.
The Pukylino Ride-On comes with 2 creative decors in sky blue and rosé to stick yourself!
All PUKY tricycles are designed so that small children who can already sit or walk can intuitively move around with them and thus further develop their motor skills.
Above all, this makes it fun to move around - and that's very important.
The sporty frame and decor design characterise the PUKY ZLX 16-1F Alu.
The very light aluminium frame offers the best riding characteristics.
It is suitable for children from a height of 105 cm who can ride a bicycle safely and are more sporty on the road.
Child-friendly characteristics and ergonomics have also been thought through down to the smallest detail in the ZLX Alu series.
There are no sharp edges on the entire bike, particularly neuralgic areas such as the handlebars and the handles are additionally padded.
The PUKY ZLX 16-1F Alu is available in black and racing orange.
The PUKY ZLX 16F Alu is the beginner bike for sporty kids with freewheel!
Experience the revolution in urban traffic
If only everything could be as easy as getting a child moving about with a well thought-out balance bike vehicle:
If only everything was as easy as getting your child started on their first tricycle.
Its suitability for everyday use has been somewhat reduced in favour of this.
Thus the PUKY ZLX 16-1F Alu does without a luggage carrier and the low entrance.
A V-brake works on the rear wheel of the freewheel model.
Puky deliberately use a less biting cantilever brake on the front wheel of their children's bikes to prevent falls during abrupt braking.

4X4 DYNAMIC STRUCTURE
The refinements of the Alma World Cup geometry reflect the development of the elite race.

With its 420 / 430 mm chainstays and the increased strength of its continuous 12 mm axle system, the Alma is more precise and responsive than ever.
The external forces acting on the frame under the rider's weight, such as cornering or ground vibration, impair control and traction.

Das Kona Honzo 27,5 verbindet 100% Trailbike-Fahrgefühl mit dem spritzigen Charakter eines modernen Hardtails und der beeindruckenden Traktion von 2,8 Zoll Plus-Bereifung.
Kona versteht seine Honzo Hardtails auch ohne Plus-Reifen schon als echte Alternative zum Trailfully.
Mit flachem Lenkwinkel, kurzem Heck und langer Front verfolgt es dieselbe Philosophie wie die Fullys der Process-Reihe und zeigt, dass noch jede Menge Zukunft im ungefederten Hinterbau steckt, wenn man alle Register der modernen Biketechnik in Anwendung bringt.
Ein steiler Sitzwinkel sorgt für satten Vortrieb berghoch.
Die serienmäßige Remote-Sattelstütze macht das Honzo zum potenten Partner bergab.
130 mm Federweg der steifen Rock Shox Pike Select DebonAir und die breiten Plus-Reifen geben Selbstvertrauen wenn der Trail steil und technisch wird.
Mit diesem Hardtail zeigst du deinen Fully-Freunden auch bergab das Hinterrad.
Bergauf sowieso, dafür sorgen die direkte Kraftübertragung und der SRAM GX Antrieb.
Die Vorteile des 27,5-Zoll-Rades sind einfach:

Felgen kompatibel mit Tubeless Reifen
Schlauchlos kompatible Felgen ermöglichen Reifen mit mehr Durchstoßfestigkeit, eine bessere Reifenhaftung auf der Spur, geringeren Rollwiderstand und Gewichtsersparnis gegenüber herkömmlichen Schlauch- und Reifen-Systeme.
12 x 148 mm Hinterradachse
12 x 142 mm, 12 x 148 mm und 12 x 157 mm Hinterachsen-Standards bieten zwei Hauptvorteile für Kona Fahrer: der Durchmesser von 12 mm bei der Hinterachse gewährleistet höchste Stabilität bei der hinteren Nabe und dem Rahmen, während der 142/148/157 mm Außendurchmesser der Nabe sicher stellt, dass das Rad schnell ist und richtig im Rahmen positioniert ist, bevor die Hinterachse eingesetzt werden kann.
Ab dem Jahr 2016 gibt es den 12 x 148 mm Standard als Mix, vor allem auf der neuen Legierung Honzos.
12 x 148 bietet mehr Reifenfreiheit an der Kettenstrebe, während das Hinterrad stabiler und beständiger gegenüber einer 12 x 142 mm Steckachse ist.

So two different kinematics were created, for the sizes S/M and L/XL.
Carbon frame
The state-of-the-art carbon frame, made of parallel aligned carbon fibers, means a minimum of weight and a maximum of stability.
The Bricktown model from Ortler offers a modern spin on an classic vintage model.
It features a slender look with the strikingly large front luggage rack which harks back to a style reminiscent of the middle of last century.
At that time, the so-called 'Porteur' bicycles features a sturdy front luggage rack, a necessity in an era where not every household had access to a car.
With the Bricktown, Ortler revives this concept again.
This practical and elegant bicycle will appeal to urban cyclists who require a vehicle that can confidently and comfortably transport them through the city.
The bike features a comfortable saddle seat, 7 gears and modern components.
Bags, backpacks and groceries can be safely transported on the luggage rack, in full view of the rider.

The luggage carrier integrated into the frame is particularly stable and allows a higher payload.
Even the bell is designed in such a way that the sound body cannot be unscrewed and thus avoids the appearance of sharp edges.
Who doesn't remember his first bicycle - a bright red PUKY...
The PUKY Z 2 is available in the colours red, lovely pink and kiwi.
Today it doesn't have to be red anymore, but from PUKY.
FRAME MATERIAL
NAILD R3ACT – 2​ PLAY​ SUSPENSION
CONVENTIONAL SUSPENSION
EQUILIBRO
BIOMETRIC GEOMETRY &amp; RIDE BALANCE
FULL INTERNAL CABLE ROUTING WITH FORGED ALLOY ENTRY CLAMPS
The full unidirectional carbon Wolf Ridge is built around the revolutionary 160mm travel Naild R3ACT – 2​ PLAY​ suspension system, producing a bike that has the widest range of climbing to descending ability on the market, making it so you no longer have to compromise on suspension travel in search of pedaling efficiency.
Countless late nights in the engineering department and early morning trail sessions combined to unlock mountain bike suspension perfection.
The NAILD R3ACT 2 – PLAY suspension system has a 60% overall reduction in damping (restriction) creating a bike that has both pedaling efficiency and bump absorption, with zero sacrifice.
So, there is always a compromise between bump absorption and pedaling efficiency.
This is made possible by a feature NAILD dubs equilibro.
Acting on Newton’s Third Law that “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,” this system provides unparalleled pedaling efficiency and bump compliance through a unique four-bar design and sliding suspension element.
This results in compression damping (restriction) in the shock to control the pedaling forces while riding.
Naild’s R3ACT – 2 PLAY system uses an advanced kinematic that establishes a greater balance in load stabilization, minimizing unwanted energy losses.
All current suspension systems balance pedaling &amp; bump forces with compression damping, or simply restriction.
Marin uses biometric fit data based on statistics of people’s body proportions, to develop the proper fit and weight distribution on each size of the Wolf Ridge.
Unidirectional carbon fiber frame Marin utilizes the latest in high modulus carbon fiber technology and materials for the lightest and strongest frame possible.
Using this data, we created four bike sizes that put each rider in the optimum position so that the center of gravity is the same for all sizes of people for balanced suspension kinematics, no matter the rider.
Full internal cable routing through the front and rear triangle requiring no zip ties or cable clamps for the cleanest look possible.
6061 forged cable entry clamps ensure your cables are neat and quiet.

The E-Madoc, Vermont's first kids e-bike.
It's light (about 18 kg, about 3 kg lighter than most other kids' e-bikes on the market) and is controlled by an age-appropriate control panel on the handlebar that controls the degree of support.
So if you want to share your love of cycling with your kids, the new E-Madoc lets you spend more time with your kids doing sports.
The battery is one of the most striking components of an e-bike system, which is why the developers at Vermont have done everything to make it as small, light and discreet as possible.
The E-Madoc concept offers young riders enough battery power, but not more.
This avoids bulky battery units with too high power.
Rear-wheel drive
For the E-Madoc, Vermont has developed a motor setup that is fully geared to the special needs of children.
Based on the standard rear drives, this system provides gentle, smooth and reliable support without completely relieving the children of their work.
And since the motor is integrated directly into the rear wheel, the children can pedal easily even when the built-in tail wind of the E-Madoc is not activated.
No narrowness, no traffic jams, no constraints - you are the king of the city.
Even if you roll past stationary cars in the city, you'll have to apply the brakes at some point.

Biometric geometry and balance
Using the latest generation of carbon technology, Marin builds the lightest and most stable frames available today.
Marin uses statistically recorded biometric data to do justice to the most diverse body proportions.
Internal cable pulls
All trains run in the frame and thus provide more safety and a clean look.
So there is always a compromise between shock absorption and pedal efficiency.
This results in compression damping (restriction) in the damper to control pedal forces while riding.
All current suspension systems compensate or limit the pedal and shock forces with compression damping.

When Santa Cruz introduced Bronson, it took the market by storm, redefining what people expected from a 150 mm trail bike.
Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.
The most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP link arrangement.
The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.
Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result.
Shock rate's been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.
Geometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.
The seat tube angle's been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power.
Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25 mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.

Because beauty also comes from within.
You knew when you planned the ride it would be a long day - a route stacked with grinding climbs and twisting descents, terrible roads with a good amount of who-knows-what-else thrown in. These rides aren’t most people’s idea of fun, but they sure are memorable, monumental, challenging.
Is that why you keep going?
Is that why you keep going?
Your buddies are preparing inside for hot bike adventures when you invite them on a "quiet tour"?
Do your favourite rounds always take you along paths that you can't find on any map?
Your tours start with the first rays of sunshine and end with a beer after sunset?
Your bike has to go through everything and always be a faithful companion?
Are you exactly the type of mountain biker we're talking about?
Then the Orbea Occam is the perfect bike for you!
140MM TRAVEL WITH 140/150MM FORK OPTIONS
Modern trailbikes are used for impressively versatile rides.
Some riders climb climbs that are thousands of feet long, while others take one lap at a time in a bike park with an infinite number of jumps.
The Occam is available with a 140mm Fox 34 or a 150mm Fox 36, so you can ride as you please.
TRAIL GEOMETRY
TRAIL GEOMETRY
Means a flatter steering head angle, which provides more stability.
The low crank gives you more natural cornering and the longer cockpit gives you more freedom of movement and balance.
The Occam's longer wheelbase gives you more stability at high speeds and the higher saddle angle gives you a more appropriate pedalling position.
Asymmetric - TEMPERATE
The right-hand support strengthens and stiffens an area subject to high stress.
Instead of using a less effective "shock tunnel", the structure of the Occam diverts the impact to the left side of the frame, allowing the asymmetric support to take a more direct path.
Carbon OMR
Asymmetric - ERGONOMICS AND EQUAL WEIGHT
The pre-impregnated carbon prepreg panels are laser-cut to minimize excess before a lengthy preforming process achieves optimum compaction with the least amount of material.
The OMR (Orbea Monocoque Race) frames are the only ones that combine high-modulus fibres with high-strength fibres.
The asymmetrical offset design offers unique advantages that go beyond stiffness and weight savings.
The shock absorber is mounted in such a way that its settings are surprisingly easy to reach and the small dimensions leave enough space for an easily accessible water bottle.
Thanks to the mould made entirely of expanded polystyrene (EPS), folds and cavities are avoided.
This straight line, which follows the shock absorber structure, is the most effective way to neutralize the suspension forces in the front triangle.
Yummy, the lightest electric scooter in the world at 6 kg, could be just what you're looking for:
A crisp 24 km/h, figure-conscious carbon, a glib design and tasty features such as an integrated display at the head of the handlebar or a fine combination brake satisfy your independent hunger for relaxed or fast rides Scooter appetite!

So: get on your bike and have an adventure!
No matter if you are a podium-gracing professional or a weekend warrior: fast response, safe riding and intuitive handling are the three factors that make a good mountain bike.
These are the cornerstones on which the engineers based their development of this lightweight, rigid frame made of 6061 aluminium.
With its complex down tube and top tube shapes and the proven Agile Ride Geometry, it ensures precise steering and lively handling.
The internal cabling not only underline the clean appearance, but also ensures reliable gear changes and reduces maintenance costs.
And the elegant mounts for racks and mudguards make it child's play to adapt the bike for utility use.
So much attention to detail turns the frame into an irresistible composition of comfort, vivacity and suitability for everyday use.
Attention, danger of addiction!
With the Attain Race you will reach undreamt-of speeds.
And you know for a fact that they can make you addicted!
But that's not the only thing this racing machine has to offer:
CUBE has focused on agile handling and extra comfort for long rides.
The 2x10 Shimano Tiagra takes care of smooth and precise shifting, while the powerful mechanical disc brakes do their job even when it's wet.
To achieve just the right blend of efficient power transmission, intuitive handling and great comfort, CUBE has designed the frame with narrow, flattened seat stays and a large-diameter cross-oval down tube.
The full carbon fork, which also saves weight, provides even more comfort.
To ensure that the complete bike is durable and safe, CUBE has put it through its paces in in-house tests.
Whether you prefer to go alone or with friends , it's not important; the main thing is that you have the Attain Race with you.
So, where are you headed?
Who says that you always have to torture yourself in sports?
CUBE disagree.
And it is precisely for this reason that the engineers for frame construction always strive for the perfect combination of comfort and control.
The Attain’s super light 6061 aluminium frame is no exception.
Its double-butted tube shapes reduce overall weight without sacrificing the rigidity for which the frames are known - CUBE proves this every day in its rigorous safety tests.
Thanks to the Smooth Welding process, the optics look as if they have been cast in one piece.
The inner cable routing also underlines the clean look.
And, as an added bonus, it ensures precise shifting performance and reliable braking in all weather.
But there's more to this bike: the tapered head tube and the mechanically shaped down tube form a rigid basis for efficient power transmission and precise steering behaviour.
The slim seat stays and full carbon fork reduce vibrations and noticeably increase riding comfort - this is especially valuable on slightly rougher surfaces and on longer rides.
Sure, CUBE loves speed - but comfort is almost as important to them!
Behind every successful project there is a clear vision.
This applies in particular to the development of a powerful e-bike!
In the case of the Reaction Hybrid Pro the vision was: more range, more trail capacity, and more riding fun!
And so the engineers have developed a completely new frame for 2020 that is even slimmer, stiffer and more versatile than ever before.
An important contribution is made by the outstanding fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit, which does its job almost silently and very efficiently.
The motor and battery are seamlessly integrated into the frame and can be easily operated via the Purion display on the handlebars.
Another plus: the battery can easily remain in the frame while charging.
The internal routing underlines the clean look and keeps maintenance at a minimum.
Of course, the frame is compatible with many practical CUBE accessories, which makes retrofitting - for example with a remote dropper seat post - child's play.
The excellent SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed gearbox offers a fantastic range of ratios and Shimano's powerful MT200 hydraulic disc brakes provide the best control in any weather.
Extra wide, non-slip Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres provide plenty of grip and comfort.
Speaking of comfort: the saddle from the Natural Fit series is still comfortable even on long rides and provides a relaxed riding feeling.
And thanks to the clever Size Split system - the Reaction Hyprid Pro is even available as a trapeze framed version - everyone can find the right combination of frame and wheel size.
Get on your bike and on an off-road adventure - you can always rely on the Reaction Hybrid Pro!
In the brand-new Reaction Hybrid frame, CUBE has put all its know-how gained over the years into the development of powerful Bosch e-bikes.
It’s perfectly tailored to the needs of the fourth-generation Bosch drive system and is even more elegant.
At the same time, it convinces with its outstanding handling and great user-friendliness.
Thanks to the smart size split system and the trapezoid version available for selected models, everyone can find the right combination of frame option and wheel size.
The battery integrates discreetly into the down tube and all cabling is internal.
This is not only great for looks, but also ensures long-lasting precise gear changes and minimal maintenance.
The 1.5" head tube and Agile Ride Geometry provide proven steering precision, and CUBE has even thought to include a side stand.
A dropper seat post is also easy to retrofit - because CUBE knows that you'll soon be getting ambitious with this bike!
Everything you need and nothing you don't: the new Reaction Hybrid.

Need to get from A to B across town as fast as possible?
The Hyde Race is the right tool for the job.
Light, quick and comfortable, it's the city bike of choice for discerning riders looking for an efficient, environmentally-friendly means of transport.
It is, in many ways, a masterpiece of understatement.
The silent Gates Carbon Drive is an important part of its appeal, rendering oil-stained clothing - not to mention regular maintenance - a thing of the past.
And it goes without saying that 'Race' isn't just a marketing tag that CUBE tacked on.
This bike has earned its speedy moniker, because we sweated the details to make it as rapid as possible in the urban jungle.
Double-butted tubes and the advanced mechanical forming process make it both light and exceptionally strong.
And the sleek, lightweight fork performs just as well as it looks, giving precise and nimble steering.
From its state-of-the-art Shimano Alfine hub to fast-rolling Schwalbe tyres and stealth looks, the Hyde Race is a pure-bred urban speed machine.
CUBE's engineers took everything they'd learned from building fast, lightweight mountain bike frames and put it to good use in the Hyde.
The frame is built with torsional rigidity - and therefore efficient pedalling - in mind.
We used double-butted aluminium tubes and the advanced mechanical forming process to put material where it's needed for strength and remove it where possible to save weight.
The CUBE Touring ticks all the boxes, combining a lightweight aluminium frame with all the features you need to enjoy your cycling.
And, because it's available in three different frame configurations - Easy Entry, Trapeze, and classic Men's - there's one to suit every rider. the Efficient Comfort Geometry ensures that you'll be comfortable and in full control, even on the longest rides, and you can rest assured that the in-house test lab has verified the strength, durability and safety of the frame and all the components.
Finishing touches like internally routed cables and ultra-neat rack and mudguard mounting points demonstrate the attention to detail that goes into every CUBE frame.
Slick-shifting Shimano gears, easy-to-use rim brakes and a comfort-enhancing suspension fork all add to the appeal, while a full complement of essential accessories means that your CUBE Touring is ready to take on any journey.
The only remaining question is, where will it take you tomorrow?
The heart of the Touring is its high-quality, low-weight, double-butted aluminium frame.
Designed with the Efficient Comfort Geometry to be comfortable and efficient for long days in the saddle, it'll surprise you with its nimble and easy handling.
The Easy Entry version is sleek and easy to use, with the best possible access for easy mounting and dismounting.
There's also a sporty-looking trapeze frame, while the men's classic diamond frame's five sizes mean you're assured of finding the perfect fit for you.
Every frame features the exceptionally neat luggage carrier and cables routed inside the down tube, which keeps the looks svelte and ensures that your gears will keep shifting smoothly for longer.
And, of course, we remembered to leave space for water bottle mounts for those long excursions into the countryside.
We like to think we thought of everything... so you can just enjoy the ride.
When the open road calls, you'll want a bike that blends comfort and pace with easy handling.
The Attain is the affordable introduction to the world of road riding and the allure of simple, unadulterated human-powered speed.
We combined proven technology and years of experience designing aluminium road bikes with a carefully curated selection of reliable components, so you can just concentrate on enjoying the ride.
Shimano's slick-shifting, smooth-braking Claris 2x8 components and grippy Continental tyres ensure you're all set to take on any road.
Features like the slim, cross-ovalised seat stays - which help improve comfort on poor road surfaces - and the tapered head tube - which enhances steering precision - are typical of the attention to detail that does into every CUBE frame.
And the Road Comfort Geometry is designed to make racking up the miles as comfortable and effortless as possible, allowing you to ride further and for longer.
Where will your Attain take you?
You shouldn't need to suffer for your sport.
It's a mantra that keeps the engineering team busy, building in more comfort and better control for every frame.
The Attain's Superlite 6061 aluminium chassis is no exception.
Double-butted tubes reduce weight wherever possible whilst maintaining the strength for which all CUBE's frames are renowned - and which we prove every day in the in-house test lab.
Smooth Welding gives the frame an organic appearance, one tube seeming to flow into the next.

A new frame construction and the "Gravity Casting" manufacturing process in combination with a low centre of gravity promise a maximum of stability and riding comfort.
DYNAMIC STRUCTURE STIFFNESS
MONOCOQUE
SMOOTHNESS
The external forces acting on the frame, such as cornering or ground vibration, affect control and traction.
The Pine Mountain is taking hardtail adventure and trail riding to the next level with classic steel frames and large volume 27.5+ tires that roll fast and grip anything.
Choose between Columbus Thron tubing and locking thru-axles on the Pine Mountain 2, or butted CroMo frames on the Pine Mountain and Pine Mountain 1 and go places you didn’t think a hardtail could.
Trail ready geometry, plus-sized tires, and wide-range 1x drivetrains makes these bikes worthy of both your daily ride and most epic trail adventures.
The Pine Mountain is a classic steel hardtail with modern trailcapabilities for hardtail purists pushing the limits and seeking adventure.
Plus-sized tires are an instant confidence boost and traction upgrade, sticking to most everything and making it possible to navigate rough and slippery trails and obstacles with new conviction.
27.5+ tires roll fast, grip anything, and their 2.8” wide high volume low pressure setup brings a new experience to trail riding.
The Pine Mountain uses a butted and formed 4130 CrMo frame with Boost compatible dropouts, full fender and rack mounts, and three bottle bosses.
STEEL IS REAL

The Pine Mountain Trail Geometry is a mix between agility for trail riding, and all day comfort for bikepacking.
Short chainsstays keep a shorter wheelbase for that active ride, while a 69 degree head angle makes for confident steering with or without the weight of gear.
One of them is the Orca, the bike designed for the exact rider who rode 6000 km in February and can still somehow maintain 500 watts in the middle of winter.
The rider with legs that look as if they were carved directly from the surrounding mountain rock; the rider you NEVER won against and who always sets the rhythm.
The Orca is for professionals, tough men, tough women and all the freaks who don't even think about giving up prematurely.
The Orca is for drivers who talk so much about watts and training that you would never invite them to your party in your life, and they wouldn't come anyway because they go to sleep earlier.
The Orca is not for everyone: do you want to be fast?
The majority of the turning and side loads are carried by the substructure of the frame.
The shape of the head tube, down tube and chainstays prevents twisting and serves to transmit power directly to the rear wheel.
Undoubtedly, large tube diameters and high flexural strength in the lower frame are directly converted into more watts on the road and direct power transmission.
Orbea uses the most innovative carbon technology in the production of the Orca frame.
A complicated, extremely careful process that makes itself felt on the road.
The Orca OMR uses a fibre blend of Toray T700, T800 and M40J.
The prepreg sheets of pre-impregnated carbon are cut to size with lasers to minimize excess.
The deformation process used allows optimum compaction with the lowest possible amount of material.
The seat stays of the new Orca are thinner to achieve maximum traction and control on rough ground without sacrificing overall stiffness due to reduced cross section and diameter.
FREEFLOW
The natural bending patterns due to carbon lamination and minimal top tube and seat stays mass allow a dynamic, smooth ride as if the wheel were hovering over the rough ground.
Rotation of the impellers in the opposite direction of the headwind leads to a draft effect on the fork.
The freeflow fork is wider to reduce pressure and turbulence.
The general directional aerodynamics are not affected, but the bike becomes faster overall due to the less chaotic airflow between the fork blades.
ORBEA RACING GEOMETRY
The racing geometry of the Orca is the result of almost 100 years of experience in the production of racing bikes and combines the perfect balance of responsiveness and stability.
The aggressive posture maximizes both aerodynamics and body efficiency.
All angles and dimensions are carefully matched to the different frame sizes.
This is how the Orca achieves a noticeably direct transmission of power from the pedal to the road!
When you've got the urge to explore off-road, you'll want a bike that's up to the task: comfortable, reliable and easy to handle.
That's why Cube developed the Access.
Like all of their female-specific bikes, it's a complete tailored package with the emphasis on all-day comfort, responsive but stable handling, and safety you can depend on.
Cube paid special attention to the geometry, saddle, stem length and handlebar width - so that every ride is a pleasure, not a chore.
Mechanical disc brakes give you the power you need to stop safely in any conditions, while 24 slick-shifting Shimano gears mean you're just a click away from tackling any trail.
There's even a Suntour suspension fork to take the sting out of the trail and the edge off potholes and bumps.
And, with the Size Split setup, there's an Access to suit any rider.
It's got everything you need and nothing you don't - just get out and enjoy the ride!
Cube's designers pride themselves on understanding what each rider wants from their bike.
For the Access that means a comfortable fit and ride, with the reassurance of the safety that you'd expect from Cube.
So Cube used the Compact Agile Ride Geometry to serve up a ride that's inspirational when you want it, and stable when you need it.
Lurking beneath the carefully applied colour scheme - which uses a multi-layer wet paint process, so it'll keep its looks through the rough and tumble of everyday life and off-road adventures - are lots of neat touches.
An emphasis on standover clearance ensures that every rider has the confidence to ride off-road, and Cube updated the mudguard and luggage carrier mounting points for 2019 to make them even neater and easier to use.
New integrated cable routing complements the frame's great looks, while keeping gear shifts smooth and brake power consistent with significantly less maintenance.
And the revised, complex section downtube is the stiff, strong and light backbone that the Access needs to respond to every pedal stroke or change of direction with instant, confidence-inspiring agility.

Got the 'cross racing bug?
This is the bike to fuel your passion: the Cross Race C:62 Pro.
A sleek, carbon-framed race bike designed to excel in the muddy hell of competitive cyclocross, it's full of clever details to make your life that little bit easier out on the race course.
For example, racers love internal cable routing for its ability to keep gear shifts reliably slick through the filthiest of conditions.
But what, the engineers wondered, if the cables were routed directly into the head tube?
The answer is in front of you: a super-clean look, absolutely no cable rub, lower weight - because the down tube doesn't need to be reinforced to accept cable holes - and shorter cables for less interference with shouldering the bike.
Speaking of which, the curved seat stays and top tube junction makes that particular task a little less uncomfortable.
And the premium C:62 carbon makes for a light, stiff and nimble chassis that'll be with you for every step and pedal revolution.
We even added changeable inserts for a future upgrade to electronic shifting - although you'll love the reliable performance of Shimano's legendary Ultegra groupset.
Fulcrum Racing 77 wheels are light and strong, Schwalbe X-One tyres grip tenaciously in the mud and a Newmen Evolution cockpit keeps you firmly in control.
So don't get cross, get the Cross Race C:62 Pro instead.
When saving every gramme is the goal, every single detail matters.
When saving every gramme is the goal, every single detail matters.
We knew that choosing the premium C:62 carbon was a good start, but the Cross Race C:62 needed something special to set it apart.
The answer came from an unusual direction: the engineering team decided to route cables internally via the head tube, rather than the usual down tube routing.
And second, it meant we didn't need to reinforce the down tube to the same extent as usual, saving even more weight.
Internal cable routing uses custom inserts which can be swapped out easily, so you can run electronic, wireless or traditional cable-actuated gears.
Combined with the full carbon fork and race-bred geometry designed for quick, precise handling, the Cross Race C:62 is proof that the devil really is in the detail.
Has cyclocross fever got you?
Then you need a bike that does its job reliably - like the Cross Race Pro: a perfectly balanced, adaptable bike that's ideal for winter training, racing or off-road exploration.
CUBE's Superlite aluminium frame and carbon fork guarantee playful handling, comfort and irresistible propulsion.
And the Cross Race Pro can do even more: because stiffness and precision are essential for a good cyclocross bike, CUBE installed 12 mm thru axles at the front and rear and opted for a tapered head tube.
Water and dirt cannot get to the cables, because CUBE has internally routed them in the down tube.
This ensures that the shifting performance from Shimano’s 105 stays reliable.
The ergonomically-shaped top tube makes shouldering the bike particularly comfortable.
This cyclocross masterpiece is completed by the hydraulic disc brakes, which quickly bring the bike to a standstill even in wet conditions.
The Cross Race Pro is already excited about racing!
Are you, too?
Cyclocross bikes are in a class of their own.
Stiffness and steering precision are non-negotiable here.
CUBE has therefore equipped the front and rear frames with 12 mm thru axles and a carbon fork - with a conical head tube - which is designed to meet the demanding requirements of cyclocross competition.
Comfort is provided by slim seat stays and the carbon fork that absorbs vibrations.
In addition, the internal cabling prevents mud and water from interfering with the shifting.
And the ergonomic top tube allows the bike to be shouldered more comfortably.
Of course, the high-performance frame uses 6061 Superlite Advanced aluminium with a mechanical tube forming process.
Thanks to the race-ready geometry, the seating position is balanced and the handling both agile and stable.
Are you ready for cross next weekend?
If you're looking for an affordable Bosch e-bike that combines easy urban mobility with elegant looks, low maintenance and all-round versatility, the CUBE Town Hybrid Pro RT should be at the top of your shortlist.

Thoroughly tested by the in-house safety lab, you can be assured that it's as strong and durable as it is good to look at, too.
CUBE included a suspension fork for greater comfort on rough roads, light and powerful Magura hydraulic rim brakes for added safety in all weathers, and easy-to-use Shimano 8-speed hub gears with a fully enclosed chain.
The Town Hybrid's frame is - despite the elegant simplicity of its looks - a tour de force of engineering excellence.
The Easy Entry frame has been specifically designed to withstand the considerable power of the Bosch drive unit, providing effortless handling thanks to the Comfort Ride Geometry and the reassurance that it's passed all the stringent in-house safety tests.
The RT model also features an additional back pedal brake, to provide an extra option on top of the standard braking system and to put you in full control.
Siting the battery unit behind the stiff, strong, triple-chamber seat tube keeps it out of the way and puts it in the best position for easy handling, while the Bosch drive unit sits inside its own gravity cast housing.
Practical touches like internally routed cables complement the frame's clean looks, as well as improving gear-shifting performance in the long term.
It's the kind of attention to detail you'd expect from CUBE.

So, what are you waiting for?
Start your adventure!
Turn up to a race or a training ride with the Agree C:62 Race and it's fair to say that you've run out of excuses.
But then again, you've also got a thoroughbred race machine on your side.
With a full Newmen cockpit setup, Shimano's extraordinary Ultegra gears and hydraulic disc brakes and a light, stiff and strong Newmen Evolution SL R.32 wheelset, this is an endurance speed machine that will bring out the best in every rider.
The tapered head tube and 12mm thru axles work together with the oversized down tube to deliver razor-sharp handling and incredible drivetrain efficiency, whilst slender seat stays and carbon fork blades are designed to help reduce rider fatigue on even the roughest of road surfaces.
Whether it's a tough climb - where the Agree C:62 Race's low weight and exceptional power delivery come to the fore - or long, fast descents - where the fade-free power of the hydraulic disc brakes and agile geometry work together to ensure you're always in full control - you're onto a winner.
This is a cutting-edge carbon frame that's equipped to perform.
The Agree C:62's superlight race chassis doesn't just look fast, it IS fast.
That's because, as with all the bikes, the CUBE design team sweated the details.
So, for example, the cutting-edge carbon frame comes complete with a matching CSL Evo carbon fork - and both feature attachment points for Flat Mount brakes to improve the bike's ærodynamics and reduce weight as far as possible.
The integrated seat clamp also looks great, but is also another small detail that makes the Agree C:62 more slippery in the air.
They're there to save weight where possible, making for an easier and more comfortable ride without compromising strength or durability.
That's why we worked hard to make sure that the Town Pro is easy to live with - because you need a bike that's comfortable, versatile and always ready to just grab and go.
We started with a stylish frame design featuring the same kind of double-butted, Superlite aluminium tubes that we use in many of the more expensive bikes.
We know that life doesn't always stop for you to maintain your bike.
Comfort AND speed: what more could a rider want?
The included luggage carrier is stable and sleek, so you can take what you need wherever you need to go.
Slender seat stays combined with a narrow-diameter seat post and carbon fork blades mean this is a bike that's as comfortable as it is speedy.
But CUBE not forgotten comfort - because a tired rider is a slower rider.
Meanwhile the PressFit bottom bracket, tapered head tube and carefully profiled down tube and chain stays build into an incredibly rigid structure that converts pedal input into instantaneous forward progress.
Now when you need a bike to get to work, run to the shops or just head out for some fresh air, the Town Pro will always be ready for you.
The heart of the Town is its high-quality, low-weight, double-butted aluminium frame.
We even made two versions - the classic men's double diamond frame and a step-through frame for easy entry - and added a suspension seat post for more comfort.
The easy-to-use Shimano 8-speed hub gears and Suntour suspension fork are there to make your life easier, and we also added mudguards, lights and a kickstand - so there's no need to accessorise your brand-new bike.
The Easy Entry version is sleek and easy to use, with the best possible access for easy mounting and dismounting, while the men's classic diamond frame's five sizes means you're assured of finding the perfect fit for you.
Designed with the Efficient Comfort Geometry to make negotiating the urban jungle as easy as possible, it'll surprise you with its nimble and assured handling.
The Town Sport Hybrid ONE, that's what: a Bosch e-bike that makes getting around town a pleasure rather than a chore.
And, of course, we remembered to leave space for water bottle mounts for those weekend excursions into the countryside.
With its Easy Entry frame and Comfort Ride Geometry, it's a bike that's as good to ride as it looks.
What happens when you take the comfort, safety and practicality of the Town Hybrid range and combine it with the wide gear range and easy shifting of Shimano's 9-speed components?

Don't be deceived by its clean lines and svelte looks.
The Town Hybrid's frame incorporates all the frame design know-how, so that you can just get on with enjoying the ride.
For example, a rigid triple-chamber seat tube works in conjunction with a gravity cast motor housing and oversized down tube to provide a stiff, secure and safe chassis that's passed all the in-house safety testing - right up to the standards we expect from the MTBs.
We put the battery in the best position for stable handling and elegant looks.
And the Comfort Ride Geometry provides a safe and natural-feeling ride position, so you'll feel right at home every time.
We even routed cables inside the frame, keeping them out of the way of everyday dirt and grime so that your gears work smoothly with minimal maintenance.
We sweat the details, so you don't have to.
Well, you're looking at it:
When you unleash a team of enthusiastic engineers and ask them to develop the ultimate racing bike, the result is likely to be pretty special.
Cube's Litening C:68 SLT Disc.
It's hard to imagine a more beautiful rendition of state-of-the-art carbon techology than the Litening C:68.
This is a two-wheeled machine that sets new standards in both looks and performance: for riders who demand only the very best.
As much art as it is engineering, the SLT Disc combines the most advanced current carbon frame construction technologies with the world's most exclusive components to achieve one goal: the ultimate race bike.
By using the most advanced C:68 fibre technology, innovative tube shapes and the Monocoque Advanced Twin Mould production technique Cube managed both to reduce the weight of the Litening C:68 SLT's frame to a sensational weight and to increase both stiffness and comfort.
Cube also added their dynamic C:68 full carbon fork, whose slim legs allow the Litening's rider to steer accurately through the tightest gap whilst also offering incredible vibration absorption.
With the range-topping SLT Disc model Cube opted for a unique groupset that'll have the same effect on riders' pulses as an overdose of espresso:
Shimano's new-for-2017 Dura Ace Di2 groupset, complete with disc brakes.
This is the kit that the pros race, and with good reason - nothing can match it for precision, smoothness or reliablity.
An Newmen Advanced SL R.25 carbon wheelset, Syntace carbon finishing components and a Fizik Antares R3 saddle complete a spec list that reads more like a wish list.
When you're pushing your personal limits as well as your equipment's, you need a bike that won't let you down.
That's where the Stereo 140 HPC TM 27.5 comes in - an uncompromising mountain tamer that puts ultimate performance and control front and centre.
Based around the Stereo 140's carbon and aluminium chassis, the designers are rightly proud of this bike's pedigree and attention to detail.
Paired with only the best components we could source, it makes for a bike that you'll just want to keep riding.
Pivots are hidden for clean looks and reduced maintenance, while the Boost 148 rear end, short rocker and tapered head tube all help make the most of the carbon frame's incredible stiffness.
For example, the Fox 36 Factory fork is paired with Fox Float DPX2 shock at the rear, providing up to 150mm (140mm at the rear) of smooth, controllable suspension travel to help tame the toughest of trails.
Fast-accelerating and tough Newmen Evolution rims shod with Schwalbe tyres provide reliable, confidence-inspiring grip even at the limits, held in check by powerful Sram Code hydraulic disc brakes.
There's a Fox Transfer dropper post to help you keep your weight low on tricky descents, of course.
And Sram's 1x12 Eagle transmission - with carbon crank - has the range, precision and reliability to get you to your destination, whichever route you choose.
Best of all, all of this matchless all mountain performance is wrapped in a package that's so good looking, no-one will believe how much travel is lurking beneath that svelte frame.
The perfect all mountain machine?
Well, we reckon it just might be.
Now it's your turn to judge...
Lots of travel used to mean ungainly rockers, unsightly pivots and a clunky appearance.
Not anymore.
The Stereo 140 doesn't just ride better than many bikes in its class, it's also one of the most elegant frames CUBE made.
In the unmistakable classical style of a genuine Ortler the tradition manufacturer with the Geneve model an all around successful long-distance travel model for her and him brought out.
That's why the pivots are hidden away, the rocker is short and all the cables are routed internally.
A hub dynamo that has been tried and tested several times ensures a permanently reliable view and the AXA lamps also offer a practical parking light function.
The built-in 30-speed Shimano XT gearshift not only offers a permanently silky smooth shifting comfort, but also works reliably and precisely like a clockwork.
The load-fairly constructed aluminum frame offers a sporty comfortable seat position and is prepared with additional eyes, disk brake admission as well as bottle holder screws for all eventualities.
The Boost 148 rear end, massive down tube and tapered head tube mean super-accurate steering and instant power transfer, while shorter chain stays, a longer top tube and a head angle designed specially for a 150mm fork all add up to the kind of razor-sharp, rock-solid handling you'd expect from CUBE.
Boasting a full carbon front end and carefully crafted aluminium rear triangle, the engineering team went out of their way to make it look as good as it rides.
We even remembered to fit ISCG05 tabs for a chain guide, so you can set it up exactly how you want.
On the front and rear wheels, no less than the Schwalbe Marathon tyre ensures smooth running and reliable puncture protection.
Ortler paid particular attention to the choice of contact points.
On the wheel the driver should be able to concentrate completely on the journey and waste no unnecessary thoughts on the wheel.
The F.O.L.D. kinematics on the FOCUS O1E are designed for pure enjoyment out on the trail, yet they also ensure maximum efficiency up in the mountains.
The Geneve comes as standard with grips and a high-quality Selle Royal brand saddle, so that neither hands nor bottom are affected even on long journeys.
This enables you to travel uphill and downhill quickly.
COMPETITION READY
The Ortler Geneve is not only at home in the French Alps, but it is a good feeling to know that with the Ortler also the biggest peaks of Europe shrink to eventful tour destinations.
From demanding trails to marathon races, with the FOCUS O1E nothing stands in your way.
The route you take is entirely up to you.
Thanks to the extremely light weight of the frame and its kinematics, you will be able to climb any mountain with ease.

Climbing and enjoying everyday life by bike:
The Ortler Fjaeril.
The PARALANE² 6.8 has a powerful Fazua drive that is well integrated into the frame.
Cube designed the Attain GTC Race to be as comfortable as it is fast.
That's why it features æro Flex Stays and a full carbon fork - to make the best possible use of carbon's natural vibration-damping qualities to improve rider comfort.
But speed is important for a race bike, too, so Cube ensured that the tapered head tube and large cross-section down tube give the frame the torsional rigidity it needs for every watt of your pedal input to be translated into forward progress.
Shimano's superb 105 transmission delivers slick, reliable gear shifts mile after mile, helped by the internally routed cables and their resistance to water and dirt ingress.
And powerful hydraulic disc brakes ensure that you have all the control and stopping power you need on even the longest mountain descents, whatever the weather decides to throw at you.
The Attain GTC's frame was developed from the ground up by the engineers to combine class-leading comfort, performance and low weight for endurance riding.
So, for example, the rear end's slim æro Flex Stays are designed to reduce the impact of road shocks on the rider - a clear advantage on longer rides, increasing comfort and reducing the symptoms of fatigue and tension.
And less maintenance means more time riding...
The big-volume down tube, combined with the PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube, ensures that the rider's efforts are efficiently converted into forward propulsion, and that every steering impulse is precisely transmitted to the front wheel.
Do you think you can cross the boundaries?
As you'd expect, we maintained the frame's elegant looks by routing cables internally, which also has the benefit of keeping gear shifts cleaner for longer.

Nomen est omen:
LR Light Br - the new lightweight among balance bikes with a brake.
Modern, sporty design, lightweight aluminium frame, Ahead stem and spoke wheels.
The LR Light Br defines the new lightness of being when riding a wheel.
Despite the low weight, we equipped the LR Light Br with a footboard.
The 12.5" pneumatic tyres optimally combine comfort and grip on all surfaces and at the same time are very quiet.
The V-Brake rear brake also decelerates safely from higher speeds and is particularly suitable for experienced pilots.
So the PUKY LR Light Br is the ideal vehicle for advanced, sporty pilots.
Parents also appreciate the low weight when the bike has to be carried.
The safety handlebar grips protect the delicate hands of children and defuse the handlebar ends.
The ergonomic wheel saddle ensures that the momentum gained is transferred to the vehicle without the child slipping forward from the saddle.
We deliberately do not limit the steering angle of our wheels.
This means that the handlebars lie flat on the ground in the event of a fall and the risk of injury is considerably reduced.
The PUKY LR Light Br is available in anthracite.
No obstacle is too big for you.
Nothing stops you.

The Rift Zone is Marins most speed oriented MultiTrac bike, created for the rider looking for the speed and roll over capabilities of 29” wheels in a trail capable package.
The Trail Motion bikes are all about more control, more comfort and more fun.
For the Stereo 120 HPC TM 29 CUBE built a completely new carbon main frame, incorporating all the features that make the Stereo 120 so popular - Agile Trail Geometry, covered rocker pivots, sleek lines and assured handling - in a new, lighter and stiffer format.
We also equipped it with everything you need to dissect the most demanding of singletrack trails with ease, time after time.

And, because this bike is likely to inspire you to ride lines you thought you wouldn't be able to, there's a dropper post for extra confidence on those steep descents.
It all adds up to a capable trail all-rounder that's simply inspirational, whether you're using it to show your riding buddies a rapidly disappearing view of your back or simply exploring new trails.
Go further, take back control - ride the Stereo 120 HPC TM 29.
In many ways the Stereo 120 is the full suspension bike that kick-started the reputation for building comfortable, high-performance trail bikes.
New for 2020, CUBE added a carbon main triangle for even lower weight - so you can enjoy your trail time more.
Years of experience in carbon frame construction means that the engineers know exactly where to add material for strength, and where they can remove it to save weight - all backed by the reassurance of the extensive in-house testing.
The rest of the frame is pure Stereo 120 goodness, featuring the short rocker, covered pivot bearings and efficient kinematics of its predecessors for superb traction, comfort and control.
The tapered head tube and Boost rear axle ensure great handling and steering precision, and big 29er wheels roll easily.

The Nature is your perfect introduction to a world of exploration and opportunity.
Built with comfort and reliability in mind, it's got all the attention to detail you'd expect from CUBE at a price that may surprise you.
And we even fitted powerful hydraulic disc brakes, for dependable all-weather stopping.
There's a good reason that the Nature is lighter than similar models from the competitors.
It's all down to the lightweight, double-butted tubes that make up the aluminium frame.
Sleek luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points complement the frame's good looks and make it easy for you to upgrade your bike for any purpose.
And, as with all the bikes, the Nature has passed every EU and in-house safety test that we could throw at it, meaning that you can enjoy your riding with complete peace of mind.
The frame, for example, features double-butted tubing - a process that removes material where it's not needed, to save weight without sacrificing strength.
Internally routed cables keep your gear shifts smooth and precise with absolutely minimal maintenance.
The Suntour suspension fork helps smooth out potholed roads, while a full range of 24 Shimano gears means you'll always be able to find the right gear for any occasion.
And, of course, the complete bike has passed the extremely stringent in-house safety tests - so you can be confident that your Nature will get you to your destination in style and complete safety.
Complex-profile top and down tubes contribute to a frame that's rigid enough for precise, safe steering, but still comfortable on any ride, while cables routed inside the down tube ensure that your gears will continue to be smooth and accurate in the long term.
A high-performance, great-value bike for riders who value both speed and simplicity, the SL Road Pro's heart is a light, stiff chassis constructed from double-butted aluminium tubes.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes ensure you can slow and stop safely in all weathers and Sram's superb 1x12 gears give you the range you need for both town and country.
And, in keeping with the bike's minimalist appeal, CUBE routed cables internally for a cleaner appearance and improved gear-shifting performance with reduced maintenance.
To put the #RVLTN in the trunk or to take the train with it, it only takes a few steps:
The low-maintenance drum brakes decelerate safely.
Equipped with an aluminium 6061 frame, a carbon fork and the complete Shimano 105 group.
There's nothing here that you don't need, but everything that you do. Experience cycling in its purest form - ride the SL Road Pro.
The SL Road's aluminium frame is made from extremely light double-butted tubes, giving the best combination of low weight, superb strength and great ride quality.
For the lightweight fork's design, we took the inspiration from the racing bikes.
The æro shape is exceptionally stiff for accurate steering, and it even looks fast to match the bike's purity of purpose.
We also routed the cables inside the down tube, adding to the bike's sleek looks and reducing wear and tear in the process - because you should be able to spend your time riding your bike, not maintaining it.
A mountain bike is a versatile beast, a Bosch e-MTB even more so.
But should you have to spend more to equip a new bike to fit your busy life?
No, we didn't think so either.
That's the thinking behind the Access Hybrid Pro Allroad - a Bosch e-bike for all reasons and all terrain, designed specifically to meet the needs of women riders.
Featuring an all-new frame and Bosch's fourth-generation CX drive unit for 2020, it's packed with features to make it sleeker to look at and easier to use than ever. the Size Split system - and the option of standard or trapeze frames - makes it easy to find just the right fit for you, whilst carefully selected contact components including a women's Natural Fit saddle ensure that you'll be comfortable on every ride.
Integrated cable routing complements the frame's sculpted looks as well as reducing the need for maintenance, and you can even charge the battery without removing it from the frame. the Allroad component kit adds day-to-day practicality in spades - from the extra splash protection afforded by the mudguards to the versatile kickstand and added safety of the front and rear lighting system, it all makes for a bike that'll slot right into your life.
At CUBE we believe that practical, durable bikes should also be fun.
The Travel Pro takes all the functionality, comfort and practicality of the Travel series and adds an 8-speed hub gear and practical low maintenance belt drive for the ultimate in hassle-free cycling.
No more oily chain, no more fiddly gear adjustment, no more worries!
You can just enjoy the ride - and who wouldn't want that?
The 29er-inspired frame is built from light, strong and durable double-butted tubing, using the Smooth Welding technology at the seat and head tube junctions for a tidy, organic appearance.
The semi-integrated luggage carrier complements the frame's sleek looks and provides strong, stable support for whatever load you want to bring along with you.
Taking the cue from the hardtail mountain bikes, we included plenty of clearance for extra-wide tyres - so you've got more grip, comfort and control, even on rough roads.
Throw in the powerful hydraulic disc brakes, full-length mudguards, light set and kickstand, and it adds up to an adaptable, rugged and hassle-free riding partner... wherever your explorations take you.
That's why the aluminium Superlite frame of the Travel is double butted, saving weight where possible but adding extra material where it's needed for strength.
Combined with the rigorous in-house testing procedures, it's your guarantee of long-lasting durability and superb ride quality.
An eccentric bottom bracket makes it easy to adjust belt tension, and we also made it simple to change the belt if needed.
We built in enough clearance to run 29er tyres up to 2.15in wide, giving loads of choice for added comfort and puncture resistance.
Full lowrider rack compatibility means that the rigid aluminium fork is both accurate and extremely versatile, and we routed cables inside the down tube to match the frame's Smooth Welding-enhanced clean looks and reduce maintenance requirements.
Simplicity can be a virtue, but we never forget that detail matters.
The result is the Acid Hybrid ONE Allroad.
We call it cross-mountain, and we reckon it's the perfect setup for busy folk looking for a bike that'll fit easily into their lives.
For commuting CUBE equipped it with full-length mudguards, front and rear lights powered by the Bosch battery, a bell and a kickstand.
For weekend adventuring the Suntour suspension fork, grippy and wide Schwalbe tyres, smooth Shimano 9-speed gears and powerful Shimano MT200 hydraulic disc brakes are all you need to explore off the beaten path.
And, of course, it's all powered by Bosch's reliable, smooth and eerily quiet drive unit and battery, sleekly incorporated into the elegant frame design in such a way that you'll forget it's there.
Double butting and advanced hydroforming have allowed the designers to shave weight wherever possible and add extra strength where it's needed, with the added reassurance of the Acid Hybrid ONE Allroad's frame having passed all of the extremely tough in-house safety tests.
Combined with the Agile Ride Geometry, it's a combination that ensures safe, predictable handling in any situation from busy city streets to deserted forest trails.
Jump on and ride wherever you fancy, because the Acid Hybrid ONE Allroad has got you covered.
The engineering team puts the same effort into every frame design, whether it's a range-topping race machine or an entry-level commuter.
That's why we gave the Acid Hybrid an aluminium Superlite chassis with double-butted tubes, which shave weight where it isn't needed and add extra thickness where strength is important.
Advanced hydroforming is what gives it its sleek looks and the elegant, oversized down tube houses both the Bosch drive unit and the battery. the acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry gives the Acid Hybrid easy, intuitive handling to keep you safe, whether you're exploring a trail or riding to the office.
And integrated mudguard mounts mean it's a cinch to fit full-length fenders to help keep you dry on the road, all year round.
At CUBE we're all about rising to the challenge.
So, when faced with the idea of combining the go-anywhere versatility of a mountain bike, the practical flexibility of a tourer and the ease-of-use of a Bosch e-bike, the engineering team didn't flinch - they got to work instead.
Built to dissolve tricky sections of trail quickly and effortlessly, the Acid is a bike that's more than capable of living up to its name.
That's why we began with mechanically formed, double-butted 6061 aluminium main frame tubes combined with a tapered head tube.
Taken together they form a rigid backbone for the rest of the frame, carefully tailored with the Agile Ride Geometry to build a chassis that's responsive and accurate.
Then we took a close look at the luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points, making them even neater than before so that you can add the accessories you need easily and, just as importantly, without ruining the clean lines of your bike.
They're what make a CUBE.
Featuring a frame that borrows extensively from its high-end cousins, it's designed to help you come out on top of any trail challenge.
Precise, accurate steering is assured thanks to a tapered steerer tube and smooth, easily adjustable RockShox Recon air fork.
Sram's NX 1x12 Eagle transmission works in harmony with the light, stiff and lively triple-butted frame tubes to propel you down the trail, while powerful Shimano MT400 brakes give you the control you need to bring it all safely to a halt.
We even incorporated neatly hidden luggage rack mounting points, so your Acid can do double duty as a weekday urban commuter or weekend tourer too.
None of this performance comes at the expense of comfort - big-volume Schwalbe tyres and slender seat stays with a 27.2mm seat post see to that.
Its high-quality aluminium frame, balanced handling and reliable components add up to a package that's perfect for trail fun.
Whether you pick the 27.5in or 29er version, you're assured of a good fit thanks to the Size Split system.
Each one is ergonomically tailored to offer a responsive, comfortable ride thanks to the Agile Ride Geometry.
And where their riding is concerned, that means they'll need a bike that's up to the task.
And a choice of colours means there's an Access 200 to suit every budding junior rider.
Just like a real mountain bike, there are V-brake bosses front and rear.
The Access 200's heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame has the same quality and durability as the full-size mountain bikes.
Add it all up, and it's the ideal introduction to off-road fun with mum and dad.
And when the climb starts to get too steep, the large 34-tooth bailout gear will lend a helping hand for tired legs.
And, with Sram's wide-ranging 12-speed Eagle transmission working seamlessly with Bosch's proven drive technology, you've the range and power to tackle everything from steep climbs to longer days out.
Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and extra-wide, grippy Schwalbe tyres ensure you're always in full control, and the Suntour suspension fork helps smooth out the path ahead.
Combine all this with the reassurance of knowing that it's passed the strict in-house safety tests with flying colours, and you've got the ultimate go-anywhere, do-anything all-rounder - just jump on and ride.
Where will it take you next?
You may have heard of the saying that the frame is the heart of any bicycle.
We're a firm believer that that's true - and it's the reason that, for the fourth-generation Bosch-powered Access Hybrid, we set out to develop a brand-new frame.
Drawing on all the experience of mountain bike hybrids, we refined an already highly regarded chassis with new features and better handling - and the Size Split system and trapeze frame option makes it easy for every woman to find her perfect fit.
With 100mm of smooth fork travel and a seat tube and internal cable routing that's ready to accept a stealth dropper post, it's designed to be comfortable to ride, easy to live with and simple to upgrade as your riding skills progress and your needs change.
We even included a kickstand mount, just in case that's something that you'd like to add. Backed by the reassurance of having passed all the strict in-house safety tests, the Access Hybrid is all you need to discover a whole new dimension to your riding.
Neatly hidden rack and fender mounts make a weekday commuter or weekend tourer conversion quick, simple and elegant.
It's everything you need to explore as far off-road as your curiosity takes you.
The engineers put just as much time, effort and energy into the most affordable bikes as they do into the very highest performance race machines.
That's because, regardless of whether you're a professional athlete chasing podium positions or an ordinary rider looking for a bike to go exploring at the weekends, you'll want a frame that'll respond quickly, safely and intuitively.
Complex top and down tubes, made using the Advanced Mechanical Forming process out of 6061 aluminium, make a lightweight, rigid backbone for precise steering and effortless acceleration, while the Agile Ride Geometry ensures a ride that's stable when you need it but nimble when you want it - the best of both worlds.
Hidden rack and mudguard mounts make a conversion to weekday commuter or longer distance explorer quick and easy, and internally routed cables ensure reliable gear shifting and clean looks.
It's all part of the attention to detail that makes the aluminium hardtails a compelling blend of comfort, liveliness and practicality.
The complex-profile top and down tubes - shaped using the proprietary Mechanical Forming process - form a strong, light and safe backbone around which the engineering team has built a light, nimble frame that'll stay the course.
The Access 200 is every inch a junior version of its adult counterpart, from the carefully constructed frame to the 7-speed transmission and powerful, easily controllable brakes.
Its heat-treated 6061 aluminium chassis has the same quality and durability as the full-size mountain bikes, but it's also as light as the engineers can reasonably make it whilst maintaining its strength.
Because we know that accidents can happen when kids are pushing their limits, CUBE made the derailleur hanger easily replaceable so that a crash doesn't write off the frame.
Details like the brake levers and alloy cranks are specially designed for small bodies, so they fit perfectly and work easily.
It's also as light as the engineers can reasonably make it, thanks to a curved and formed down tube designed specifically to suit a young rider's weight.
Because we know that accidents can happen when they're pushing their limits, CUBE made the derailleur hanger easily replaceable so that a crash doesn't write off the frame.
The Acid 200 is every inch a junior version of its adult counterpart, from the carefully constructed frame to the 7-speed transmission and powerful, easily controllable brakes.
The Acid 200's heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame has the same quality and durability as the full-size mountain bikes.
At CUBE we understand this only too well - it's the reason we developed the Cross Race C:62 SL.
Featuring a full carbon chassis - complete with cyclocross-specific carbon fork - and a component setup geared for hard use on the race circuit, it's got the low weight, exceptional efficiency and brilliant handling you'll need to stay out front on race day.
Internal cable routing via the head tube eliminates cable rub and, combined with the curved seat stay / top tube junction, makes shouldering easier, quicker and more comfortable.
Don't be deceived by its deliberately understated looks - the Travel EXC is no ordinary sports tourer.
A lightweight machine built around Shimano's low-maintenance 8-speed Alfine hub gear and Gates' durable belt drive, it consigns rattling gears, oily chains and the chore of regular maintenance to the past.
The classically elegant frame design features double-butted aluminium tubing for the best combination of low weight, high strength and great ride quality.
CUBE built in enough clearance for tyres up to 47x622, giving access to a wide range of options suitable for the toughest of touring routes.
Wherever you're headed and whatever load you're carrying, the low maintenance drive belt and smooth simplicity of the hub gears mean you can concentrate on the adventure, and stop worrying about the bike.
With powerful hydraulic disc brakes, a lightweight and strong rigid fork with lowrider rack compatibility and a full complement of touring gear - including kickstand, lights and mudguards - it's the ideal lightweight, round-the-world companion.
We built in enough clearance to run 28in tyres up to 47mm wide, giving loads of choice for added comfort and puncture resistance.
Don't be fooled by its deliberately understated looks.
Under its unassuming exterior the Hyde Pro is a true urban lifestyle bike for riders who value both form and function.
Simple, elegant and light, its true strength lies in its adaptability - because this is a bike that's capable of taking on pretty much anything.
Its light but stiff aluminium frame - built from a double-butted tubeset to save weight without sacrificing strength or safety - is based on the 29er hardtail mountain bike model.
That's good news, because it's designed to be tough, comfortable and versatile.
The tried and tested 8-speed hub gear with belt drive perfectly fulfils the demands of an urban all-rounder, serving up the gears you need while demanding practically nothing in the way of ongoing maintenance.
Hydraulic Shimano disc brakes provide powerful, easy-to-control stopping ability in any weather conditions, while the sleek rigid fork contributes to the Hyde Pro's overall low weight.
We even made it easy to add a luggage carrier and mudguards, with sleekly hidden mounting points that preserve the bike's clean lines.
Put it all together, and the Hyde Pro is the nimble, adaptable companion that you need for navigating the urban jungle not just safely, but in style and comfort.
Few bikes can do more to expand your horizons than a Bosch e-bike hardtail - combine mountain bike toughness and versatility with the ease of use of Bosch's superb fourth-generation CX drive system, and you've got a winning combination.
Brand new for 2020, the Reaction Hybrid ONE is the affordable hybrid mountain bike that'll help you ride further, faster and more often, even when the road ends and you find yourself exploring a narrow ribbon of dirt.
The completely revised frame incorporates everything CUBE learned about building class-leading e-bikes into a chassis that's better looking, stiffer and more versatile than ever before - and, because it's available with the Size Split setup, every rider is certain to be able to find the perfect size.
Compatible with CUBE accessories, incorporating a kickstand mount and ready to accept a remote dropper post, you can customise it to suit your own needs.
The 100mm Suntour suspension fork smooths out the path ahead, while powerful Shimano MT200 hydraulic brakes put all-weather stopping power at your fingertips and wide, grippy Schwalbe tyres offer plenty of reassuring grip and comfort.
Star of the show, of course, is the Bosch CX drive unit and dedicated battery, which serve up miles and miles of smooth, quiet pedal assistance in combination with Shimano's slick-shifting, wide-ranging 9-speed transmission.
Explore more - ride the Reaction Hybrid ONE.
CUBE years of experience building Bosch-powered mountain bike hybrids - and we put all of that knowledge to good use in the brand-new Reaction Hybrid frame.
Designed around the needs of Bosch's superb fourth-generation drive system, we built a frame that's sleeker, better handling and easier to live with than ever - and, with the Size Split system and a trapeze frame option on some models, CUBE the perfect size and fit for every rider.
Housing the Bosch battery securely in its gravity cast down tube, the engineers also routed all cables internally to keep them out of harm's way and keep gear shifts clean and precise with minimal maintenance.
The 1.5in head tube and Agile Ride Geometry delivers impeccably precise steering, there's an integrated kickstand mount and we even ensured that there's routing for a stealth dropper post upgrade, so your Reaction Hybrid will stay with you as your riding skills develop.
It's everything that you need, and nothing that you don't.
Built to handle the rough-and-tumble of everyday use with the assurance of having passed the tough in-house safety tests, its light, durable, heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame is designed with the same care that we put into all the bikes.
You'll know when cyclocross has really got to you, because you won't be able to wait until the weekend comes around again.
The Cross Race C:62 SLT was developed for cyclocross aficionados with mud running through their veins: ultralight, perfectly formed and equipped with the simple goal of winning in mind.
Built with the premium C:62 carbon, the engineers sweated the details to save weight wherever possible.
So, for example, they removed the need to reinforce the down tube by routing cables straight into the head tube.
The LED lighting system - driven from a hub dynamo, so you never have any worries about batteries running out - is permanently on and built to withstand any weather conditions, so young riders can always see and be seen.
Aspiring trail explorers, your search is over:
The Aim Pro is the affordable, capable bike you need to fuel your burgeoning off-road passion.
Combining a light, stiff and nimble-handling frame with a selection of easy-to-use, reliable components including Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and a comfortable suspension fork, it's the ideal choice for exploring further afield when you've run out of road.
But just because it's affordable, that doesn't mean CUBE skimped on the details.
From internal cable routing for clean looks and long-lasting smooth, reliable gear shifting with minimal maintenance to hidden rack and fender mounts for quick and easy upgrades, every detail is designed to make the Aim Pro an easy bike to live with.
And, as you'd expect, the Size Split system makes it easy to find the right frame and wheel size combination to suit any rider.
Let the adventures begin!
There's a smooth RockShox suspension fork to keep the front wheel tracking straight and true even on rough trails, powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes to ensure you're always in control, and Sram's wide-ranging and slick-shifting 1x12 gears to help tame any climb.
Race-bred geometry provides sharp, nimble handling and the premium C:62 builds into a light, exceptionally stiff and responsive frame that you'd expect of a thoroughbred racer.
To keep things simple, we chose Shimano's new 1x11 transmission and fitted a custom chain guide, so you don't have to worry about an unshipped chain ruining your day during the rough and tumble of racing.
The 11-40T cassette provides a huge gear range, transferring power to the light, stiff Newmen Evolution wheelset and grippy Schwalbe X-One tyres, and Shimano hydraulic discs ensure you can control your speed through the worst that the elements and race course can throw at you.
With Newmen Advanced carbon cockpit components shaving even more weight, it's a package that's shouting out to be ridden hard.
Now all you need to do is pedal, run and pedal your way to the podium...
That's why, for example, there's a replaceable gear hanger - to reduce the chances of a mishap causing an expensive repair.
But there's more to this bike than the frame, because CUBE added smooth-rolling tyres and a host of practical add-on accessories to create a bike that's perfect for adventurous young riders, wherever their curiosity takes them.
Brake levers designed for small hands make it easy to control the V-brakes, while a power modulator at the front helps prevent over-the-bars incidents caused by over-enthusiastic braking.
Shimano's 7-speed gear system is easy to use and reliable, giving little legs the range they need to tackle most hills.
Carrying belongings is easy thanks to the included cargo rack, and full-length mudguards help keep clothes dry even when the weather isn't cooperating.
And the Ella 200 doesn't even need a wall, tree or fence to stay upright, because we added a built-in kickstand.
We reckon we thought of everything.
The Ella 200's heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame has the same quality and durability as the full-size mountain bikes.
And a choice of colours means there's an Ella 200 to suit every budding junior rider.
Nutrail.
Go-anywhere freedom has a name:
This is a bike that holds its line off-road no matter how steep, rocky, loose or slippery the surface.
Higher, further, faster more... the SL Road SL could have been built for Strava KOM chasers or, in fact, anyone who enjoys the thrill of greater speed and more distance.
A featherweight, minimalist speed package combining Shimano's superb Ultegra groupset, powerful hydraulic disc brakes and DT Swiss wheels, it's crying out to be ridden hard.
The frame fulfils three vital criteria: it's light, it's stiff and it looks great.
With its carbon bladed fork it's surprisingly comfortable, too.
Cables are routed inside the down tube to preserve the frame's good looks and the accuracy of the gears, and we even remembered to include fixing points for accessories like mudguards and luggage carriers.
In the right hands, there's no reason why this bike shouldn't be very nearly as fast as a race bike.
You have been warned...
If there's an aspiring young mountain biker in your family, chances are they're already pushing their boundaries.
Shimano's 1x11 SLX transmission provides a simple, reliable and incredibly wide-ranging choice of gears via its 11-46 tooth cassette, putting the right gear selection for any trail situation a click or two away.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes add easily controllable, all-weather stopping ability, and we selected a Suntour air-sprung suspension fork with 70mm of travel, rebound adjustment and a lighter negative spring specifically designed for lighter riders.
It's easy to set up and offers noticeably improved comfort, grip and control.
It's easy to set up and offers noticeably improved comfort, grip and control.
Schwalbe's Smart Sam 2.35in tyres add confidence-inspiring grip and comfort.
It's ready to rock...
It's ready to rock...
And, of course, the frame is designed with the same devotion and fanatical attention to detail that the engineering team puts into every CUBE chassis.
We don't believe in cutting corners at CUBE.
From its heat-treated, mechanically formed 6061 aluminium tubes to the child-focussed geometry, it's the perfect foundation for a trail-shredding junior explorer.
It's the reason that the junior frames use the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes that you'll find in the adult bikes, as well as the same mechanical tube forming process to adjust tube shapes for the best combination of strength and weight.
A low top tube - and geometry tailored to provide a blend of confidence-inspiring stability and fun-enhancing rigidity - work together to make the Reaction 240 TM both zippy and safe.
Your child will love it and you will too, safe in the knowledge that CUBE sweated the details.
A replaceable derailleur hanger means that little accidents needn't result in a large repair bill, and the engineering team made room for wide tyres for the best in grip, comfort and safety.
If you want to get more fun out of your riding, you could do a lot worse than invest in a CUBE Bosch e-MTB.
And, if you're going to do that, there are very few bikes around that can match the Reaction Hybrid Race for value and performance.
Blending all the engineers' accumulated experience in a beautifully crafted, completely revised frame designed around the requirements of Bosch's fourth-generation CX drive unit, it represents a new standard in great value, high performance off-road e-biking.
Keen riders will spot the attention to detail in areas like the 1.5in head tube - for superb steering accuracy - and a 30.9mm seat tube that's remote dropper post ready, in case you want to take your riding to an adventurous new level.
The neatly integrated Bosch CX drive unit and battery deliver a seamless, quiet and smooth power boost for mile after mile, working in tandem with Shimano's new XT 12-speed transmission and its incredibly wide-ranging 10-51T cassette.
Make light work of every climb, explore further afield or just fit more into your riding time - it's all there for the taking.
A RockShox Judy Silver air fork serves up 100mm of easily adjustable, rock-swallowing travel and extra-wide, grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres roll smoothly and easily down the trail.
Power is, of course, nothing without control - and that's why we fitted powerful Shimano four-piston hydraulic disc brakes.
And the Reaction Hybrid Race is available with the Size Split setup, so every rider can find their perfect fit.
Whatever your riding ambitions, this is the bike to put the fun back into every pedal stroke.
If your junior mountain biker has caught the racing bug, they'll need a bike to make the most of their evolving skills and fitness.
That's why we built the Reaction C:62 Youth - a light, fast, carbon-framed hardtail built to the same standards as the adult race bikes.
Crafted from the premium C:62 carbon using the Advanced Twin Mold process, it boasts exactly the same features you'd expect to see on a World Cup athlete's bike.
The tapered head tube and 12mm thru rear axle combine to create a stiff, precise frame.
At the same time, slender seat stays and a narrow 27.2mm seat post make the most of carbon's inherent vibration-damping properties to improve comfort.
The result is a bike that's as fast as it is good-looking - so, of course, we needed to give it the best components.
The air-sprung Manitou Markhor fork works with wide, grippy Schwalbe tyres to deliver impeccable comfort and control, while Sram's NX Eagle drivetrain serves up 12 wide-ranging, perfectly-spaced gears for tackling even the toughest of tracks.
Answer Attack MA rims are light enough for racing but tough enough to stay the course, and Magura MT4 hydraulic disc brakes offer fantastic stopping power in all weathers.
All that's needed for a podium finish is a keen young rider with the will to win...
Small, but perfectly formed: that's the Reaction C:62 Youth.
Boasting the same frame features and attention to detail as the full-size Reaction C:62 frames, it's the light, stiff and responsive frame that'll make the most of your young racer's energy and enthusiasm.
The tapered head tube, short rear end and stiff chain stays ensure that every single watt expended at the pedals goes towards propelling the bike forwards, but slim seat stays and a narrow 27.2mm seat post work with carbon's natural vibration-damping properties to deliver a ride that's surprisingly comfortable, too.
Internal cable routing keeps gears shifting cleanly and reliably through the worst trail and weather conditions - and dad won't have to spend his time fiddling with adjustments.
If you're looking for just the right blend of comfort and performance in a mountain bike, the Access WS Exc will fit the bill very nicely.
It's a full-blown junior racer, and it should give your own junior racer all the excuse they need to pedal their heart out... and have fun.
Featuring the well-regarded Access frame - with Size Split system so that every rider can find her perfect fit - it also boasts a great selection of components chosen for their performance, ease of use and reliability.
The wide-ranging 24-speed Shimano transmission puts the right gear for any occasion at your fingertips, while the Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure you're always in full control, no matter what the weather throws at you. the Compact Agile Ride Geometry is designed to make your Access WS Exc nimble and confidence-inspiring, and of course all the rider contact points are designed for women riders to ensure the best possible fit and all-day comfort.
We like to think CUBE thought of everything, so that you can simply concentrate on enjoying the ride.
You'll find the same attention to detail in the Access frame as you would in, say, one of the top-of-the-range race bikes.
Built around the Compact Agile Ride Geometry, the Access frame is designed to offer the best possible fit for day-long ride comfort, as well as confidence-inspiring handling.
A slightly lowered top tube improves confidence by adding extra standover clearance, whilst the down tube provides the strong, rigid backbone that's essential for a stable ride and accurate steering.
Mudguard and rack mounting points are tucked away out of sight, and cables run internally to keep them out of the way of the elements and to reduce maintenance.
And, of course, it's met and exceeded the exceptionally high standards we set in the own in-house torture-testing lab - so you can rest assured that it'll be a reliable, safe companion for years to come.
One bike, many reasons:
The Nature Hybrid ONE Allroad is the Bosch e-bike that'll slot right into your life.
Fully equipped with mudguards, an AXA and Busch & Müller lighting system that runs off the Bosch battery and a kickstand, it's ready to go wherever you go.
So neatly integrated is the Bosch motor and battery, many people won't even spot that you're riding an e-bike - and they're protected from the elements, too.
Choose the 400Wh battery for everyday use, or the more powerful 500Wh version for extended range.
There's no need to remove the battery for charging, and features like a tapered head tube and double-butted frame tubes contribute to a frame that's strong and durable enough to pass the in-house safety tests with flying colours.
Grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure you're always in full control, while the Suntour suspension fork tackles the rough surfaces and potholes of modern urban riding with ease.
Star of the show, though, is undoubtedly the reliable and smooth Bosch drive unit.
Feeding both your and the motor's power to the rear wheel via slick Shimano gears, it makes every ride a pleasure.
And, with a trapeze frame option and a wide range of sizes, CUBE got every rider covered.
From city street to country lane, it's the ideal two-wheeled companion.
There's some clever technology lurking in the smooth, clean lines of the Nature Hybrid. the engineering team worked overtime to position the Bosch battery and drive system optimally for both the men's and the trapeze frame designs.
Using complex hydroforming and gravity casting, they created a frame that combines the Efficient Comfort Geometry with a low centre of gravity for handling that's completely intuitive - lively when you need it, stable the rest of the time.
A light, stiff structure translates into a bike that's as easy to pedal as it is to steer.
Internal cable routing complements the svelte appearance, and the added bonus is that gear cables tucked out of harm's way in the frame reduce maintenance and help to keep your gear shifts clean and smooth for longer.
As we like to say at CUBE, it's the details that count.
One of the defining characteristics of the designers is that they never rest on their laurels.
With the brand-new, fourth-generation Bosch CX-powered Reaction Hybrid EX, they've pulled out all the stops to build a Bosch e-MTB that will help redefine what's possible from a hybrid hardtail.
The frame is a masterpiece of elegantly functional engineering, combining sleek good looks with incredible handling, unmatched practicality and the superb strength and durability that you'd expect as a result of the extensive in-house testing - and it's available in a trapeze frame option, too.
A brand-new Modular Battery System encloses the Bosch power unit inside the gravity cast down tube and allows for even more range, whilst oversized chain stays, a Boost rear axle and a 1.5in head tube ensure that the power delivery is as efficient as it is smooth.
A dropper post-ready seat tube, revised geometry and elegant Smooth Welding complete the picture.
To make the most of this amazing new frame, we selected components that offer great value and performance.
Up front, the Suntour XCM34-Boost fork delivers accurate steering and 120mm of trail-smoothing travel, whilst 2.6in Schwalbe tyres serve up unbelievable grip and comfort.

You'll be amazed what this bike can do for your riding.
We were - and we were the ones who designed it.
CUBE's dedicated engineering team is never satisfied.
For the brand-new Reaction Hybrid 29 - powered by Bosch's fourth-generation drive system - they went back to the drawing board with a clean sheet of paper and a simple mission: to build the best possible hybrid hardtail frame.
Starting with the new Modular Battery System, they designed a new gravity cast down tube to completely enclose the Bosch power unit under an easily accessed cover.
It doesn't just look great, it also frees up enough space for bottle cage bosses and the option of a larger capacity battery for even more range.
Oversized chain stays, an X12 Boost rear axle and 1.5in head tube work together to transfer the smooth, powerful Bosch drive unit's torque to the rear wheel. the widely acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry is tweaked and refined to work brilliantly with a 120mm fork, giving handling that builds confidence when you need it and delivers inspiration when you want it.
Internal cable routing - including provision for a stealth dropper post upgrade - complements the frame's svelte looks, and we even designed a trapeze version.
Add it all up and it's clear to see: there's a Reaction Hybrid 29 with your name on it.
With the Aim SL Allroad we took all the good things about the range-topping, affordable aluminium hardtail and added mudguards, a luggage carrier, CUBE kickstand and an integrated lighting system for added versatility.
Beautifully designed mounting points mean that these practical, essential accessories blend almost seamlessly into the frame's svelte looks, making it as well suited to the urban jungle as it is to forest trails.
Agile Ride Geometry and the proprietary Aluminium Lite frame create a bike whose handling is every bit as good as it looks, and with the reassurance of having passed all the stringent in-house safety testing.
The Shimano 27-speed gear system offers a huge range of gears and slick, precise shifting with absolutely minimal maintenance, thanks to the neat internal cable routing.
An easily configurable Suntour suspension fork, powerful all-weather Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and dynamo-powered lights are the finishing touches.
It all adds up to a bike that'll tackle any challenge you care to put its way, whether on road or off.
And the Size Split system ensures that, whatever your height, there's an Aim SL Allroad frame and wheel combination that'll fit you perfectly.
Representing a halfway point between a kid's bike and a full-size adult's mountain bike, the Access 240 is the ideal choice for growing riders who want to keep up with their friends and parents.

From the heat-treated, mechanically formed 6061 aluminium tubes to the child-tailored geometry, the engineering team lavished the same attention to detail and perfectionist approach on this bike as they do on every bike they design.
The low top tube improves confidence and safety, while a replaceable gear hanger makes the inevitable mishaps and knocks less costly.
And, as you'd expect, the entire bike has passed the stringent in-house safety tests with flying colours.
With a bike like this, there's nothing standing in the way of epic off-road adventures for the little mountain bikers in your family...
The Access Hybrid Pro combines the riding experience of a real mountain bike with the unhampered mobility and freedom that only a fourth-generation Bosch e-bike can offer.
It's a powerful combination, and one which we're sure you're going to love.
Brand new for 2020, the engineers have created an entirely fresh frame design.
Built around the specific requirements of Bosch's superb CX drive unit, it draws on the years of experience working on both hybrids and mountain bike design to create an elegant, functional and easy-to-live-with frame.
With an On-tube battery mount and neat features like integrated cable routing, CUBE put the emphasis on easy handling and dependable reliability - and we're super-confident making that claim, because as with all the frames CUBE put it through the mill in the own in-house lab to ensure it's more than strong and durable enough for the job.
Sram's incredible SX Eagle 12-speed gears provide easy selection and an amazing range of ratios - more than enough to tackle even the steepest of climbs with ease, when combined with the smooth torque and effortless power delivery of the Bosch system.
The Suntour suspension fork works with the extra-wide 2.6in Schwalbe tyres to smooth out the trail ahead, and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure you've always plenty of power to control your speed, come rain or shine.
It's everything you need for trail-exploring fun, so what's stopping you?
The Attain GTC SL is a masterpiece of both æsthetics and function, even if we do say so ourselves.
A high-performance race bike in its own right, it combines the sublime comfort of a high-tech carbon frame with the speed-enhancing safety of the latest in disc brake technology.
The ultimate high-speed endurance machine?
We like to think so.
Shimano's peerless Ultegra gears, compact and elegant 105 disc brakes and a Fulcrum Racing 77 wheelset blend the taut, elegant and surprisingly comfortable carbon frame to make a consummate long-distance mile-muncher.
Carbon fork blades and deliberately slender seat stays help filter out harsh vibrations from rough road surfaces, while 12mm axles front and rear combined with a tapered head tube and cross-ovalised down tube ensure that all your effort goes into propelling you forward - and that the powerful brakes can bring you quickly and safely to a stop, whatever the weather.
Efficiency, comfort and performance: it's all in the Attain GTC SL's genes.
Built around a light, responsive, easy-to-handle 6061 aluminium frame, it features the kind of attention to detail you might ordinarily associate with far more expensive bikes.
From the internal cable routing - which keeps the appearance tidy and your gears shifting cleanly with minimal maintenance - to the hidden fender and rack mounting system, CUBE brought high-end looks and functionality to a new level of affordability.
The RockShox Reacon XC30 fork adds extra comfort and control, while Shimano's smooth-shifting Deore 2x10-speed transmission with wide-ranging 11-42 tooth cassette puts even the steepest of climbs within your reach.
And, of course, we fitted powerful all-weather Shimano hydraulic disc brakes to put you in complete control.
With perfect sizing assured thanks to the Size Split system, the Agile Ride Geometry gives you the confidence to tackle any trail.
It all adds up to a versatile, easy-to-live-with hardtail that'll slot right into your active lifestyle.
The clue's in the name:
Reaction Pro.
If you reckon that means we're really getting down to business with this bike, you'd be right. the popular all-rounder hardtail retains all the features that have made the Reaction a go-to choice for keen riders, like a mechanically formed, double-butted 6061 frame with super-sleek luggage carrier and fender mounts for added versatility.
Weekend warrior or weekday commuter (or both) - the Reaction Pro can handle it all.
Shimano SLX and XT 1x12 transmission components bring slick reliability and an enormous gear range to the indomitable mid-ranger, putting any climb within easy reach with a system that's easier to use than ever.
We fitted a RockShox Recon air fork at the front for added comfort and control, as well as easy adjustability to suit any rider.
And with the Size Split system there's bound to be a Reaction Pro that will fit you, whatever your height.
This is a bike that's crying out for some fast singletrack action, but just as happy to take you to work: truly, a bike for all reasons.
The competition had better be ready for this. the high-end cyclocross race machine is as subtly understated as it is uncompromisingly rapid - truly, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
CUBE thrown all the aluminium frame-building expertise at the Cross Race SL, added a cyclocross-specific carbon fork and then fitted Shimano's new cyclocross-ready GRX 1x11 groupset with wide-ranging cassette and powerful hydraulic disc brakes. the advanced mechanical forming process enabled the engineers to manipulate tube shapes to create the ideal blend of stiffness and comfort, as well as adding a specially shaped top tube for more comfortable carrying.
The carbon fork and slender seat stays help reduce rider fatigue, while internal cable routing ensures gear shifts are clean and precise from the start of the race to the end.
To all of which we can add only one thing: with a bike this good, it's a shame the cyclocross season is so short.
Cyclocross bikes are a breed apart.
Stiffness and steering precision are both must-haves, so we added 12mm thru axles front and rear and specced a carbon fork - with tapered steerer - that's been specifically designed to cope with the rigours of cyclocross.
To add a dose of comfort we made sure that narrow seat stays and the carbon fork blades were capable of filtering out vibration.
Internal cable routing prevents mud and water from interfering with smooth gear shifting, while the ergonomic top tube is specially designed to make shouldering the bike more comfortable.
And of course, the whole chassis makes use of the Superlite Advanced 6061 aluminium alloy and mechanical tube forming process.
Are you ready for race weekend?
Because the Cross Race definitely is.
But it's not just about looks, because every aspect of the Ella is designed for safer, easier handling.
With a strong integrated luggage carrier and the reassurance of CUBE's impeccable safety and quality standards, it's a versatile companion that will slot seamlessly into your busy life.
Wide-ranging Shimano 9-speed gears combine with the Bosch motor to make light work of any journey, and there are powerful hydraulic disc brakes to bring you safely to a halt, whatever the weather.
A comfortable suspension fork takes the sting out of rough city streets, and details like mudguards, lights and kickstand mean CUBE taken care of all the essentials, so you can just enjoy the ride.
Guaranteed to put a smile on your face, whatever colour you opt for...
As interested as they are in producing beautiful frames, the engineers also know how important it is to get the technical aspects right.
With the Ella Hybrid they've combined elegant, almost minimalist looks with a stiffness and strength that's the foundation of a safe bike that handles intuitively.
Built around the strong, hydroformed down tube, the CUBE design team has made it as easy as possible to step in and out of the Ella.
The integrated luggage carrier doesn't just complement the frame's looks, it's also very stiff and a fantastically practical and secure way of carrying your belongings.
We even routed the cables inside the frame, which makes gear shifting smoother and helps keep things neat and tidy.
The cute Ella Ride Hybrid blends environmentally friendly e-mobility with a refreshingly stylish take on bicycle design that you'll love: a Bosch e-bike for the fashionista in you.
The designers always start with a clear goal in mind.
In the case of the Reaction Hybrid Pro, it was a simple one: build a Bosch e-bike that will help its rider get more out of the trails they ride.
To that end, they went back to the drawing board for 2020 and came up with a brand-new frame design that's sleeker, stiffer and more versatile than ever, incorporating Bosch's fourth-generation CX motor.
Integrated cable routing complements the clean lines and reduces maintenance, whilst compatibility with CUBE accessories and a remote dropper post makes upgrading and accessorising a cinch.
The seamlessly integrated Bosch drive unit and battery, controlled via a Purion handlebar-mounted interface, quietly and efficiently gets on with the job of boosting your pedal power for easier climbs, faster routes and expanded horizons.
Sram's superb SX Eagle 12-speed transmission provides an awesome gear range, while Shimano's smooth, powerful MT200 hydraulic disc brakes ensure you can control your speed whatever the weather or trail conditions.
Extra-wide, grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres offer ample grip and cushioning and the Natural Fit Sequence saddle ensures you'll stay comfortable on even the longest rides.
Best of all, the Size Split system - and the option of a trapeze frame - means that there's a Reaction Hybrid Pro to suit every rider.
Which means that there's nothing stopping you from getting more out of your riding...
The Ella Cruise Hybrid is defined by the distinctive, fresh design language of both frame and components.
Elegant and understated, it's a modern classic that you'll be proud to be seen on.
But don't judge it just by its looks, because this urban Bosch e-bike also boasts the kind of attention to detail that you'd expect from a far more high-end machine.
The high-quality and innovative frame features easy handling, the reassurance of having passed the rigorous in-house safety tests, and a built-in luggage rack that's perfect for effortlessly carrying your everyday belongings.
Bosch's benchmark drive technology is matched to Shimano's reliable and easy-to-use 7-speed hub gear, for hassle-free power to get you around town and further afield.
The evergreen Acid Hybrid ONE continues to set the standard for a versatile, affordable and rugged Bosch e-bike.
Add it all up and the conclusion is obvious: the Ella Cruise Hybrid is a class act.
And a host of reliable components - from the powerful hydraulic rim brakes to the comfortable suspension fork and beautifully thought out, colour-matched finishing details - are all designed to make your cycling both safe and fun.
Combining the rugged appeal of the mountain bikes with the comfort and adaptability of the touring machines, it's the go-anywhere two-wheeled companion that'll slot right into your life - and there's even a trapeze frame version, so everyone can find the perfect fit.
The advanced hydroforming that enables the engineering team to build such an elegant, tough and rigid frame is also your guarantee of long-lasting safety and performance, thanks to the stringent standards of the in-house testing processes.
The powerful and reliable Bosch drive unit, neatly contained in its own housing, is powered by the battery slotted neatly into the custom down tube.
Working seamlessly with the wide-ranging, easy-to-use Shimano 9-speed gears, they provide quiet, unobtrusive and smooth assistance to back up your pedalling.
Wide Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres - easily accommodated by a revised frame design with extra clearance - provide ample grip, easy rolling and smooth comfort on any surface. the Natural Fit saddle and carefully selected bars, stem and grips ensure you'll be comfortable on any ride, long and short.
Shimano's powerful MT200 hydraulic disc brakes serve up plenty of stopping power in all weathers, and the Suntour suspension fork adds 100mm of bump- and pothole-smoothing travel to the mix.
From city streets and the daily commute to weekend off-road exploring, the Acid Hybrid ONE has got it all covered.
The Reaction C:62 Race exudes racing flair from every frame tube and each component - which is why it's earned the Race tag.
And yes, it's every bit as fast as it looks.
Its elegant chassis condenses everything the engineering team has learnt about high-performance carbon frame construction into a light, strong and responsive frame.
From the short chain stays and Boost rear axle to the slender, vibration-absorbing seat stays and tapered head tube, every detail is honed for speed and efficiency.
Which means, of course, that we didn't skimp on the components - it has everything an aspiring racer could possibly need for a season of podium-chasing.
A RockShox Reba with remote lockout, Sram's legendary 1x12 transmission and Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes, Answer Attack wheelset shod with Schwalbe tyres and Newmen cockpit components leave no room for doubt: this is a bike that will allow you to perform at your very best.
Are you ready to push the limits of your performance?
Because the Reaction C:62 Race most definitely is...
The Reaction C:62's frame condenses everything the engineering team has learnt about high-performance carbon frame construction into a light, strong and impressively responsive chassis.
Crafted from the premium C:62 carbon using the Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing process, it's a masterpiece of minimalist perfection.

Slim seat stays and a 27.2mm seat post help ensure you'll stay comfortable for longer, even when you're giving it your all.
And internal cable routing keeps gear shifts clean and precise in even the worst riding conditions, reducing the need for maintenance and ensuring you never miss a shift.
And everything is designed to be as light as possible - because less, after all, is more.
We even remembered to include cable routing for a dropper post, should you wish to upgrade in the future.
The Reaction series represents something rather special - it's CUBE's Formula One class of mountain bikes.
Light, stiff, responsive and built for one purpose only: to get from A to B as quickly as possible.
To that end, CUBE poured all the accumulated carbon frame-building experience into it.
Short chain stays, a Boost thru axle at the rear and tapered head tube up front all contribute to impressive steering accuracy and incredibly efficient pedalling, all wrapped up in the Agile Ride Geometry for impeccable control.
Fast-rolling 29er wheels make light work of the trail, aided and abetted by slender seat stays for more comfort and a RockShox Judy air fork for superb control in the rough.
We even incorporated cable routing for a stealth dropper post upgrade, if that's where your ambitions take you.
And, as you'd expect, the design team selected Shimano's superb 1x12 XT and SLX components for their unparalleled gear range and legendarily smooth, reliable performance.
It's all set to take on any cross-country challenge, but it's missing one vital component: you.
Sleek, light and simple, its sole purpose is to transport you from A to B with the minimum of fuss.
What more could you need?
And powerful hydraulic disc brakes mean you'll always be in control, so you can stop safely in all weathers.
Fast from point to point, whether on your daily commute or a training ride on country roads, it represents both great value and minimalist cool.
The SL tag isn't one we use lightly.
That's why, with the Attention SL, we set out to create a whole new benchmark for value and performance.
Borrowing inspiration and ideas from the high-end race bikes, the product managers started by selecting a RockShox Recon air-sprung fork for the ultimate in easy adjustability and smooth, progressive, bump-swallowing travel.
They added powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and a 180mm front rotor for assured stopping in all conditions, and finished off with Shimano SLX 2x11 gear components.
And, because the frame is the heart of every bicycle, they lavished the same level of attention to the 6061 aluminium tubes that make up the Attention SL's chassis.
Mechanically formed into complex profiles for the ideal combination of strength, stiffness and weight, you can rest assured that it's more than tough enough to pass the stringent in-house lab testing.
Agile Ride Geometry means it's nimble and confidence-inspiring, and details like internal cable routing and hidden rack and fender mounts are the icing on the cake.
With Size Split sizing guaranteeing a perfect fit for every rider, there's bound to be an Attention SL to suit you.
This is what freedom looks like: the brand-new Access Hybrid ONE.
Combining the go-anywhere flexibility of a mountain bike with the ease of use of a fourth-generation Bosch CX-powered e-bike, it's the two-wheeled companion that'll open up new horizons for you.

The Suntour XCM suspension fork helps smooth out the road or trail ahead, while grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes give you the confidence to ride, whatever the weather.
CUBE chosen a 9-speed Shimano transmission for its reliability, ease of use and seamless integration with the Bosch motor - so you can concentrate on the ride rather than worrying about the gears.
And, brand new for 2020, the engineers have created an elegant frame that incorporates all of the mountain bike and Bosch e-bike know-how.
Because they lavish the same care on every bike, wherever it sits in the range, you can rest assured that it's right up there with the best of its kind.
With neat features like integrated cable routing and an On-tube battery mount, it's designed for stable handling, ease of use and rock-solid dependability, all backed up by the stringent in-house safety tests.
And the unique Size Split system means there's an Access Hybrid ONE to fit every woman.
What are you waiting for?
Adventure beckons...
We built the Reaction Race with one thing in mind: speed.
Well, OK, maybe three things: speed, comfort and versatility.
Size Split means there's a perfect fit for any rider.
Oh, and did we mention it's designed to go fast?
The Reaction Race represents the state of the art in aluminium hardtail frame construction.
Light, strong ,efficient - that's the way we roll.
It features double-butted, mechanically formed aluminium tubes for efficient power transfer and accurate steering, backed up by the PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube with integrated sealed bearings.
It boasts internal cable routing, so your gear shifts stay cleaner for longer, even in filthy trail conditions - and there's provision for a stealth dropper post, too.
And, with the Agile Ride Geometry, you can be sure of the inspirationally stable-but-lively ride quality for which all the bikes are justifiably famed.
The RockShox Judy air fork, big-volume Schwalbe tyres and skinny seat stays all contribute to a ride that's more comfortable than you might expect.
Add powerful Shimano Deore hydraulic disc brakes and Sram's hill-devouring 1x12 transmission, and it's all you need for wherever you want to ride.
Features like stealth dropper post compatibility, Agile Ride Geometry and a tapered head tube mean this is a bike that will encourage you to push your skills out in the hills and mountains.
With its light, agile and responsive C:62 carbon frameset and completely uncompromising component selection, the Reaction C:62 SLT is the bike to head up your race machine wish-list.
The Boost rear end, tapered head tube and carefully profiled top and down tubes work together to deliver exceptional torsional rigidity for more accurate steering and efficient power transfer.
But refined frame details and responsive geometry aren't enough on their own - we know that you also need components that won't let you down.
That's why we selected only the best of the best for this speed machine.
From Sram's XO1 1x12 Eagle transmission to the Magura MT8 Pro hydraulic disc brakes, Newmen wheelset and RockShox SID Ultimate fork, we simply gave the product managers free rein to make the right choices.
The Sram carbon crankset and Newmen carbon cockpit are the icing on a particularly sweet cake.
Whether you're chasing your buddies or another podium, the Reaction C:62 SLT won't let you down.
It may be an unusual approach, but we treat the design of the kid's bikes every bit as seriously as we do the adult range.
That's why the Acid 260 Disc features the same mechanically formed 6061 aluminium tubes as the full-size Acid hardtails, but built around smaller 26in wheels and an 80mm suspension fork for the best possible standover height.
Lower standover is important for young riders, since it helps boost confidence - and it's safer, too.
We fitted Tektro hydraulic disc brakes for strong, dependable all-weather stopping ability and Shimano 3x8 gears for their reliable performance and wide range.
Internal cable routing looks great and keeps gear shifts clean and crisp with the minimum of maintenance, whilst an integrated kickstand mount means you can easily add this useful accessory.
CUBE thoroughly tested every aspect of the Acid 260 Disc in the in-house lab, so you can be sure it's more than strong and durable enough to withstand lots of enthusiastic use.
And the Suntour suspension fork is the finishing touch that your kids will love, matching mum and dad's bike and adding a useful dose of extra comfort and control.
Feed their curiosity and enthusiasm with a bike that's up to the task...
No half measures: that's the motto by which the engineering team lives.
So, for the Acid 260, they applied the same care and attention to detail as they would for one of the adult bikes.
Mechanically formed, double-butted 6061 aluminium tubes are crafted into a light, stiff and strong chassis that's as lively to ride as it is confidence-inspiring.
Combined with the Agile Ride Geometry, it means that this is a bike that'll allow your child's skills to develop.
A replaceable gear hanger means a crash needn't be the end of the world, and internal cable routing ensures gear shifts stay accurate through many, many hours of enthusiastic riding in all weathers.
It's a proper mountain bike, just scaled down to size.
It wasn't too long ago when people laughed at 29er wheels.
Well, with the Stereo 170 TM 29 they're definitely not laughing now.
A mountain-flattening machine with surprisingly agile handling and an ability to swallow daunting trail obstacles whole and spit them out in manageable-sized chunks, it's proof that you can have your cake and eat it.
CUBE ploughed all the experience of building great-riding four-bar full-suspension bikes into engineering this frame, resulting in a big-travel big wheeler that defies both gravity and expectations.
As usual, the devil is in the detail - and CUBE sweated those to provide longer travel up front and more progressive shock performance at the rear.
How?
How?
The 180mm RockShox Lyrik fork is complemented by an angle-set in the slack position for better handling, while the TwistLoc actuated RockShox Super Deluxe rear shock's flip chip gives hard-charging riders the control and progression they need on the big hits.
The short rocker, covered pivots and rock solid e*thirteen bar and stem combo all help keep everything on track even when the trail's getting rowdy, so you can just concentrate on nudging your limits.
A dropper post ensures you can laugh in the face of 'impossible' lines, while powerful four-piston Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes haul the e*thirteen wheelset and 2.35in tyre combo to a stop in any weather and on any trail and the 1x12 Shimano XT transmission gives you the gear range you need to tackle any trail, down or - yes - up.
Is this bike all things to all riders?
No. But if you like your trails steep, relentless and fast, the Stereo 170 TM 29 has got your back.
And that's got to feel good, right?
There's nothing the engineering team like more than a challenge.
So when we asked them to create a genuine big hit-capable full-suspension frame with clearance for wide 29er tyres, they didn't look at us as though we were mad.
They just got down to work.
Using all the experience they've gained from years of refining the four-bar suspension design, they tweaked the position of every linkage and frame joint until they were happy with the result, then refined every tube profile for the optimum blend of weight, strength and efficiency.
With a short linkage, shock mount and covered bearings, it's clearly part of the CUBE full suspension family.
Agile Trail Geometry and advanced suspension kinematics result in an exceptionally adept mountain tamer, with progressive suspension and a confidence-inspiring feeling on the trail.
Hydroformed tubes, internally routed cables and the design team's usual fastidious attention to detail mean that it looks as good as it rides.
So the only remaining question is, will you accept the challenge and push your boundaries?
Because this is a frame that proves it can be done.
Keen young riders will benefit from a bike that fits their needs - literally.
The new Acid 260 borrows heavily from the adult hardtail range to create a 26in-wheeled bike with a low standover for confidence and safety.
It uses the same mechanical tube forming process as the full-size bikes and, as you'd expect, the 6061 aluminium chassis has passed all the in-house tests to ensure it's strong, durable and safe in the hands of your youngsters.
Internal cable routing reduces clutter and maintenance, and there's an integrated kickstand mount so you can add this handy extra without ruining the bike's clean looks.
The Suntour XCT suspension fork has 80mm of bump-absorbing travel for rough trails, and the 24-speed Shimano gears cover a wide range to put every climb within reach.
Light, powerful and easy to adjust V-brakes keep it all in control, and grippy tyres help keep the rubber side down.
It's every inch a proper mountain bike, for your proper little mountain biker.
Light, strong, simple, versatile... and perfectly proportioned for a keen young rider to get the best from it.
That's the Reaction 240 SL, the no-compromise junior hardtail built with aspiring racers in mind.
Featuring a heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame and matching lightweight aluminium rigid fork, the design team took a minimalist approach to build the lightest, most reliable and most capable kid's mountain bike they could imagine.
Mechanical tube forming allowed the engineers to tailor tube shapes for the best combination of strength and weight, whilst a low top tube - and geometry tailored to provide a blend of confidence-inspiring stability and fun-enhancing agility - work together to make the Reaction 240 SL both fun and safe.
The powerful V-brakes are easy to control thanks to levers designed for small hands, and a power modulator on the front brake reduces the risk of an unscheduled over-the-bars dismount caused by over-enthusiastic braking.
Shimano's slick-shifting SLX 11-speed gears cover an enormous range, putting even the steepest of climbs within reach of a determined youngster.
And big-volume, super lightweight folding Schwalbe tyres offer loads of grip and comfort for confidence-inspiring handling in the dirt, whilst wheels with a reduced spoke count save even more weight.
Your child will love it and you will too, safe in the knowledge that CUBE sweated all the details.
A low top tube - and geometry tailored to provide a blend of confidence-inspiring stability and fun-enhancing rigidity - work together to make the Reaction 240 SL both zippy and safe.
The Touring Hybrid EXC does just that, putting the best-quality components at the fingertips of its rider for the ultimate in hassle-free Bosch e-bike reliability.
Based around the sleek, durable and easy-to-ride Touring Hybrid frame - available in Men's, Trapeze and Easy Entry variants to suit any rider - the product managers have selected the kit that's proven itself over time.
So, for example, there's an 11-speed Shimano XT and SLX transmission with wide-ranging 11-46 tooth cassette - putting the right gear for any hill just a click or two away.
Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with an upgraded four-piston front calliper offer smooth, powerful stopping in any weather conditions, while 47mm Schwalbe tyres give you the comfort and control you need to stay safe.
The easily adjustable, air-sprung Suntour suspension fork helps smooth out even rough road surfaces, while the suspension seat post ensures you'll stay comfortably seated on longer rides.
Combined with the carefully crafted frame with integrated luggage carrier for safe, intuitive handling - and a selection of finishing components including full mudguards, integrated lighting system and a kickstand - it's all you need for miles of smiles, wherever your next journey takes you.
Truly, a Bosch e-bike for all reasons.
Internal cable routing reduces clutter and maintenance and helps keep gears shifting cleanly.
And the integrated luggage rack is such a neat idea, you'll wonder how you managed without it.
The result, when combined with the proprietary Efficient Comfort Geometry, is a Bosch e-bike that handles just as good as it looks.
We reckon the Swiss were onto something when they invented the do-it-all pocket knife.
On the other hand, we also think we can go one better: the do-it-all Bosch e-bike.
The Reaction Hybrid Pro Allroad combines all the rugged appeal of a go-anywhere mountain bike hardtail with the practical versatility of a tourer, all served up with the boost of Bosch's smooth, powerful fourth-generation CX drive unit.
Boasting a completely revised frame for 2020, dedicated attachment points for the included kickstand, mudguards and lights mean that the Reaction Hybrid Pro Allroad's svelte looks aren't spoilt by the addition of these essential accessories.
The sleekly integrated Bosch CX drive unit and battery seamlessly dish out mile after mile of rider-boosting torque and power via the slick-shifting, wide-ranging Sram SX Eagle 12-speed transmission, putting every hill within easy reach and promising longer, faster and more adventurous rides - and there's no need to remove the battery for charging.
A Suntour suspension fork offers 100mm of bump-absorbing travel, smoothing out the ride with the help of Schwalbe's extra-wide, grippy and comfortable Smart Sam tyres.
And, thanks to strong and easily controllable Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, you'll always be in full control of your speed, whatever weather you find yourself riding in. The added bonus is that, because of the Size Split system and the option of a trapeze frame, every rider will be able to find their perfect fit.
From urban commuter to weekend adventure seeker, the Reaction Hybrid Pro Allroad has got you covered.
Just don't forget to pack your pocket knife too...
The CUBE engineering and factory race teams have the answer: the Stereo 150 C:62 Race 29.
We took all the experience we gained building race-winning bikes for the Enduro World Series, and condensed it into a bike that'll inspire you to do more.
Careful tube profiling, Boost 148 rear axle spacing and a tapered head tube give this frame a rigidity that belies its svelte appearance, so that you can rely on it to transfer every watt of pedal power into forward motion and respond instantly to steering input.
C:62 carbon and the design team's long experience of working with this amazing material ensure that it's got the durability and strength to stay the course, too.
Smooth-rolling Fulcrum 29er wheels and big-volume Maxxis tyres give you the grip you'll need to tame any mountain trail, whether up or down.
Keeping all that rubber on the ground is a pair of RockShox air springs - a Lyrik Select Charger fork up front and Super Deluxe Select+ shock at the rear.
Powerful Magura hydraulic disc brakes help keep your speed in check, and Sram's legendary Eagle 1x12 transmission gives you the range you need to tackle any climb or descent.
Topped off with a remote dropper post for those particularly tricky steep chutes, it's got ride-anywhere versatility written all over it.
Actually, it hasn't - the design team wouldn't let us.
But, as a Stereo 150 C:62 Race 29 rider you'll just know: this bike rocks.
The clean lines, rocker cover and trunnion-mount shock are designed to combine efficiency, stability and intuitive handling.
ISCG05 tabs for a chain guide are standard, while short chain stays ensure agile handling and, in combination with the 75.5-degree seat tube, provide efficient climbing.
Jack of all trades?
Jack of all trades?
We prefer to think it's master of them all.
What happens if you combine the rugged, go-anywhere ability of a mountain bike with the ease of use of a Bosch e-bike... and tailor it specifically for women?
The brand-new, Bosch CX Generation 4-powered Access Hybrid Race is what happens - a bike that'll open up new horizons, whatever kind of riding you're into.
The clue is in the details.
Built around the brand-new Access frame with Size Split, so that you can be certain of finding exactly the right fit for you, this bike represents the culmination of years of expertise in design - of both great-handling women's mountain bikes and brilliantly reliable, powerful Bosch e-bikes.
For example, you can charge the battery without removing it from the frame, and the motor cover can be removed with just a single screw.
Integrated cable routing complements the frame's clean lines and keep gear shifts flawless even through dust, dirt and water, and we even added provision for a dropper post upgrade, should you find your riding becoming even more adventurous.
But a frame is only as good as the parts bolted to it, and that's where the Access Hybrid Race really shines.
From the RockShox Judy Silver air fork - easily adjustable for any rider weight and riding style - to the powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and big-volume, tenaciously grippy Schwalbe 2.6in tyres, CUBE selected components that are renowned for their ease of use and reliability.
Shimano's new XT and SLX 12-speed transmission works flawlessly with Bosch's drive system to deliver an incredible gear range and smooth, easy shifts.
You'll be flying up climbs you never thought possible - and the 500Wh battery gives you the power you need to extend your riding horizons further than ever.
We can promise you one thing: this bike will keep you coming back for more.
What would your ideal all-round touring bike look like?
What would your ideal all-round touring bike look like?
We reckon it'd look a lot like the Travel SL.
The Travel SL is ready to go anywhere.
Tasked with designing the ultimate low-maintenance, go-anywhere tourer, the engineers came up trumps with this belt-driven, hub-geared beauty.
Shimano's smooth-shifting, wide-ranging Alfine 11-speed gears give you the range you need to tackle any hill with ease, while Gates' ultra-durable and practically silent CDX belt drive makes oily chains and rattling gears a thing of the past.
Double-butted frame tubes give a supple ride quality, low weight and exceptional strength, backed up by the reassurance of comprehensive testing in the own 24/7 safety lab.
The light, accurate rigid fork is fully compatible with lowrider racks, while the semi-integrated rear rack is a masterpiece of minimalist, functional design.
Wide tyre clearances and a full complement of touring accessories are the icing on the cake.
When the urge to explore further afield becomes too much to resist, you'll need a partner in crime - or, at the very least, a bike that'll be with you for every turn of the pedals.
CUBE built the frame around two different wheel sizes so that every rider can find her perfect fit, from the 13.5in frame with 27.5in wheels to the 19in 29er.
Whichever one you choose, the light and grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam 2.25in tyres, combined with the remote lockout-equipped Suntour fork and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, give you all the comfort and control you need to tackle any road or trail with confidence.
Smooth-shifting and wide-ranging Shimano gears will help you tackle even the steepest of climbs, and we selected the rider contact points - like grips, handlebars and saddle - specially to fit the female form.
Get inspired and get riding... with the Access WS Pro.
When you buy the CUBE Travel, the adventure comes free with the bike.
By combining a lightweight, comfortable frame based around 29er wheels with a semi-integrated luggage carrier for neater looks and more secure load carrying, CUBE created a consummate all-rounder.
Double-butted aluminium tubes combine strength and rigidity with low weight for the optimal blend of stiffness, durability and comfort and the rigid fork is light, accurate and robust.
Whatever the scale of your adventure - from a trip to the coffee shop to a longer route out into the hills at the weekend - it's the perfect companion.
There's loads of clearance for wide, grippy and comfortable tyres, while the full-length mudguards help keep you cleaner and drier even in bad weather.
Shimano's 3x9-speed gears and powerful hydraulic disc brakes are smooth and reliable, and a full complement of accessories - including lights and kickstand - means you're all set for comfortable two-wheeled exploration.
You can look at it this way: the Travel is your gateway to cycling freedom.
When you've got the urge to explore off-road, you'll want a bike that's up to the job: comfortable, reliable and easy to handle.
That's why we developed the Access.
Like all of the women-specific bikes, it's a complete tailored package with the emphasis on all-day comfort, responsive but stable handling, and safety you can depend on.
We paid particular attention to the geometry, saddle, stem length and handlebar width - so that every ride is a pleasure, not a chore.
Mechanical disc brakes give you the power you need to stop safely in any conditions, while 24 slick-shifting Shimano gears mean you're just a click away from tackling any trail or hill.
There's even a Suntour suspension fork to take the sting out of the trail and the edge of potholes and bumps.
And, with the Size Split setup, there's an Access to suit every woman.
It's a bike that has everything you need and nothing that you don't - just get out and enjoy the ride!
Where can you find a roadworthy kid's bike that's also ideal for family trail rides? the design team is one step ahead of you - allow us to introduce the Access 200 Allroad.
With all the cool factor of a real mountain bike, it also has all the safety features that parents want for peace of mind.
The heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame benefits from the same attention to detail as all the bikes, so it's the ideal foundation on which to build your child's confidence and riding skills.
With an easily replaceable gear hanger you can rest assured that little mishaps needn't result in expensive damage - perfect for an enthusiastic junior rider who's just finding their cycling feet.
The child-specific V-brakes are specially adapted to work well with small hands and feature a power modulator on the front brake, to reduce the chance of a sudden handful resulting in an unscheduled dismount... and tears.
Shimano's smooth-shifting 7-speed transmission has enough range to help tired legs up big hills and fresh legs speed down the other side.
And then we added a pair of high-quality LED lights powered by a hub dynamo - which means there are no batteries to run out - and a pair of snap-on mudguards.
It's everything your youngster needs to ride safely on road and off.
There's no better introduction to the joys of exploring by bike…
Where can you find a roadworthy kid's bike that's also ideal for family trail rides? the design team is one step ahead of you - allow us to introduce the Acid 200 Allroad.
There's no better introduction to the joys of exploring by bike...
Whether it's a business meeting that's overrun or a weekend ride that ends up taking you further than you expected, the Nature Allroad can handle it - urban mobility and rural freedom, all rolled into a safe, stable and easy-to-use package.
Its state-of-the-art frame is a masterpiece of practical, functional engineering.
Double-butted aluminium tubes save weight without sacrificing strength, and RILink compatible carrier mounts tuck neatly inside the rear dropout area so that everyday accessories don't spoil your Nature Allroad's good looks.
With features like a comfortable Suntour suspension fork to iron out the bumps in the road, powerful hydraulic disc brakes for safe all-weather stopping, mudguards with a built-in rear light, Easy Mount kickstand and smooth, reliable Shimano gears, the daily commute is going to be a pleasure rather than a chore.
And, with its light, responsive frame and easy luggage carrier upgrade, it's all the bike you'll need for weekend fun, too.
All of which goes to show that practical doesn't have to be boring...
Complex-profile top and down tubes contribute to a frame that's rigid enough for precise, safe steering, but still comfortable on any ride, while cables routed inside the down tube help ensure that your gears will continue to be smooth and accurate in the long term.
Whether you're tackling a longer commute or fancy exploring further afield at the weekends, the Touring Hybrid Pro is the Bosch e-bike for the job.
Bosch's Performance motor gives ample power to boost your own pedalling, backed up by a long-lasting 500Wh battery for excellent range.
Quiet, unobtrusive and reliable, it works seamlessly with Bosch's clever software to deliver a ride that's so smooth, you'll soon forget that you're riding a pedal-assist bike.
Whichever option you choose - Easy Entry, Trapeze or Men's - the engineers have worked hard to integrate the Bosch system into a frame design that's as strong and safe as it is elegant and easy to live with.
The low centre of gravity ensures safe handling, and the fact that every CUBE frame has to pass the stringent in-house testing is your guarantee of a long and trouble-free life.
Throw in the integrated luggage rack, the mudguards and lights and a set of components picked specifically for their reliability, and you've got all you need for any riding adventure.
From the comfortable Suntour suspension fork to the wide-ranging Shimano Deore 10-speed gears and powerful, all-weather hydraulic disc brakes, there's everything here that you need .... and nothing that you don't.
We even included a suspension seat post for extra comfort on those longer rides at the weekend.
Now, where will your next adventure take you?
One of the hallmarks of the CUBE Touring Hybrid range is its versatility.
But it was just as important to us that this versatility should be available to the widest possible range of riders - which is why we set the engineers the task of designing not one, but three frame designs.
We knew they'd come up trumps, and they did.
Whether you opt for the Trapeze, Men's or Easy Entry version of the Touring Hybrid, you can be assured of a frame that's passed the rigorous in-house safety testing.
Each one positions the Bosch drive unit and battery optimally, using a combination of clever frame manufacturing technologies like complex hydroforming and gravity casting, so that weight is kept low and stiffness is kept high.
You know that saying, 'power is nothing without control'?
We took it to heart with the Access WS EAZ.
That's why it's equipped with powerful, easy-to-control Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and grippy, easy-rolling Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres - so that you can be assured of safe, all-weather braking at all times.
It's just the kind of attention to detail that we put into every one of the bikes.
You might not initially notice features like the internal cable routing, but you'll be glad of it because it helps keep your gears shifting smoothly with absolutely minimal maintenance.
We also lowered the top tube slightly for extra clearance, and fitted hidden rack and fender mounts for added versatility.
Like all the WS bikes, the designers selected women-specific rider contact points for the best day-long comfort, whilst Size Split means every rider can find her perfect fit.
Throw in the Suntour suspension fork and reliable Shimano gears, and it all adds up to a recipe for enjoying every ride.
You may not regard yourself as a pro, in cycling terms.
But the Town Sport Hybrid Pro takes its job - as an easy-to-live-with, safe and dependable urban Bosch e-bike - very seriously.
That's why we equipped it with Shimano's wide-ranging Deore 10-speed transmission.
With easy shifts and an extraordinarily broad gear range, there's not a hill too steep for you, the Town Sport Hybrid Pro and its powerful Bosch Performance drive unit.
The Easy Entry frame's careful weight distribution, Comfort Ride Geometry and extensive in-lab safety testing means you can rest assured that it's safe and easy to handle - it's the least you'd expect from the CUBE design team.
Strong and dependable Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide safe, assured stopping in any weather conditions and the Suntour suspension fork - with lockout - takes the sting out of potholed streets.
We even fitted an adjustable stem and suspension seat post, so you can be sure of the best possible fit and a comfortable ride.
And the integrated luggage carrier - which complements the frame's sleek looks - provides an exceptionally strong, stable and secure platform for you to carry everything you need with you.
That's why this bike is a Pro: we sweated the details, so that you don't have to.
You might say we're biased, but we reckon the Touring EXC is the ideal all-rounder - perfect for longer rides at the weekend, daily use as a traffic-beating commuter or just as an excuse to get out in the fresh air and exercise.
With a slick-shifting and ultra-reliable Shimano 3x10-speed transmission and powerful, all-weather hydraulic disc brakes, it's ideally equipped to help get you through the everyday - or escape it completely.
The lightweight aluminium frame is a masterpiece of understated CUBE design, incorporating a plethora of neat design touches like internal cable routing for reduced maintenance, and hidden luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points.
Available in Easy Entry, Trapeze and classic Men's configurations and a wide range of sizes, there'll be one that's the perfect fit for you.
And, with the benefit of the Efficient Comfort Geometry, you know that every mile will be a pleasure, from the first to the last.
We added a luggage carrier, full mudguards, a chain guard, kickstand and hub dynamo-powered lighting system so that you're fully equipped for any eventuality, and topped it all off with a Suntour suspension fork to help you take the rough with the smooth.
Add it all up, and the Touring EXC is a versatile, reliable and - dare we say it - positively inspirational two-wheeled companion.
Now go and explore...
Not only does this shave precious grammes, it also eliminates cable rub and makes shouldering and running with the bike quicker and easier.
Combined with the full carbon fork, geometry that's all about razor-sharp handling on the race course and a full selection of race-worthy components, the result is little short of astonishing.
Sram's wireless Force AXS 1x12 groupset offers mud-proof gear-shifting precision, an incredible range of ratios and assured, predictable stopping via hydraulic disc brakes.
Light, stiff and strong Newmen Advanced wheels shod with grippy Schwalbe tyres cut through mud for the best possible drive and control, while Newmen Advanced carbon cockpit components are the perfect match for the frame's impeccable credentials.
Indulge your winning streak - race the Cross Race C:62 SLT.
It keeps going where others have long since thrown in the towel, thanks to the extraordinary levels of grip and cushioning available from the 4.4in Schwalbe Jumbo Jim tyres.
Born out of necessity when riders were looking for a solution to riding in snow or soft sand, the fatbike has come of age and extended its versatility way beyond those surfaces.
It's the reason we equipped the Nutrail to take on anything, starting with the incredible range and easy, reliable shifting of Sram's SX Eagle 1x12 transmission, which gives you the ratios you need to tackle any trail, anywhere, anytime.
Manitou's fatbike-specific Mastodon fork will hold your line come what may, and powerful Shimano MT400 hydraulic disc brakes give you complete control.
As for the frame, it's a masterpiece of CUBE design detail.
For example, the use of triple-butted and hydroformed High Performance Aluminium tubes allowed the engineering team to put extra material where it's needed for strength and rigidity, and carefully remove it where weight can safely be saved.
The result is a fatbike that defies expectations for weight, while performing superbly.
Riding is believing.
Expand your horizons - ride Nutrail.
Building a great fatbike isn't just a question of cramming extra-wide tyres into the frame - there are other considerations, too.
For example, the use of triple-butted and hydroformed High Performance Aluminium (HPA) tubes allowed the engineering team to put extra material where it's needed for strength and rigidity, and carefully remove it where weight can safely be saved.
A fatbike chassis that defies expectations for weight, while performing superbly.
The result is a unique fatbike chassis with specially tailored geometry and the kind of attention to detail that you'd expect from CUBE.
That's why, for the Nutrail, we took the usual approach of sweating every single detail.
The tapered head tube, oversize PressFit bottom bracket and 197mmx12mm rear thru axle work together to create an extremely stiff and efficient platform for pedalling, while details like a replaceable gear hanger and dropper-ready internal cable routing add to its appeal.
Fat really is the new versatile.
Make no mistake about it - the Reaction Hybrid SLT represents the state of the art in aluminium e-MTB technology.
Completely reworked and redesigned for 2020, we're as proud about this Bosch e-bike member of the CUBE family as we are of all the range-topping SLT models.
And you don't have to look far to see why.
The smooth, elegant lines of the aluminium tubes disguise a wealth of clever design and engineering details.
Key to this bike's success is the new CUBE Modular Battery System, which encloses a new, higher-capacity battery entirely within the gravity cast down tube, where it's protected from dust, dirt and water.
The custom motor housing provides a stable, secure platform for the fourth-generation Bosch drive unit, while a Boost rear axle, oversized seat stays and rigid 1.5in head tube all combine to ensure that it can deliver its smooth, quiet power to the rear wheel as efficiently as possible.
Stealth dropper post compatibility, revised Agile Ride Geometry and chain stay protection with integrated cable routing are the icing on the proverbial cake.
Of course, all the SLT models are only as good as the components we fit to them - which is why we chose only the best for the Reaction Hybrid SLT.
The Fox 34 Rhythm fork, combined with 2.6in Schwalbe tyres, serves up 120mm of rock- and root-swallowing travel to smooth your path forward, whilst a transmission comprising Shimano's new XT and SLX 12-speed components means you've got slick, reliable shifting over the widest possible gear range - and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with an oversized 203mm rotor at the front give you the power you'll need to stop safely, come rain or shine.
It really is fully equipped to take on any challenge.
Which only leaves one question: where will you be riding tomorrow?
Oversized chain stays, an 12mm Boost rear axle and 1.5in head tube work together to transfer the smooth, powerful Bosch drive unit's torque to the rear wheel. the widely acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry is tweaked and refined to work brilliantly with a 120mm fork, giving handling that builds confidence when you need it and delivers inspiration when you want it.
The SL Road is cycling stripped down to arguably its purest form.
Featuring an aluminium frame built from light, strong, double-butted tubes for the best combination of strength, comfort and durability, we matched this efficiently pared-down chassis with a rigid aluminium fork for nimble handling and low weight.
Reliable, slick-shifting Shimano 2x8-speed gears keep working smoothly through all weathers, thanks partly to internal cable routing and its ability to reduce wear and tear.
It may lack bells, whistles and other adornments, but the SL Road's simplicity is its raison d'être.
The Town Hybrid ONE Bosch e-bike has been designed with one clear goal in mind: to make your life easier.
The elegant Easy Entry frame, easy-to-use Shimano 7-speed hub gears and smooth, powerful Bosch drive unit will deliver you from A to B almost effortlessly and in complete safety.
The cunningly sited battery is tucked out of the way, while a completely enclosed chain and included mudguards help to keep your clothes clean and dry while you ride.
The luggage carrier is perfect for bringing your essentials with you, there's a kickstand for park-anywhere convenience and an included lighting system ensure you can see and be seen at all times of day.
We even included a comfortable suspension fork to help smooth out rough road surfaces.
The frame bristles with neat design features like internally routed gear cables - which reduce clutter and maintenance requirements - and Comfort Ride Geometry, for stable and intuitive handling.
And, of course, it's passed all the stringent in-house safety tests with flying colours, so you can be assured that it's more than strong and durable enough to withstand the rough and tumble of everyday life.
Just jump on and ride - it'll fit so easily into your life, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.
The Town Sport Hybrid EXC is one part workhorse, one part urban traffic-beater and one part weekend escape vehicle.
A bike, in other words, for all reasons.
The smooth shifting and exceptionally wide range of Shimano's superb SLX and XT 12-speed components, combined with the powerful Bosch Performance drive unit, makes light work out of even the steepest of hills.
And, with a standard 500Wh battery tucked neatly behind the seat tube, you've no worries on running out of juice.
The Easy Entry frame combines elegant good looks with comfort, poise and the reassurance of having passed the in-house safety tests with flying colours.
We even routed gear cables internally, to complement the frame's neat lines and help reduce maintenance requirements.
The integrated luggage carrier is a strong, stable and elegant way to transport your belongings in complete safety, whether you're nipping across town or planning a longer excursion.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes include an upgrade to a four-piston front calliper, for even safer stopping in all weather conditions.
The suspension seat post, adjustable stem and smooth RockShox Paragon Gold suspension fork ensure that you'll be comfortable all day long.
And a full complement of practical accessories - including mudguards, a chain guard, kickstand and lights that are neatly integrated to run off the Bosch battery - means you don't need to spend a penny more to get the bike that you want.
Meet the Stereo 150 C:68 TM 29 - an enduro bike that'll recalibrate your expectations of what's possible on a mountain bike.
Built around a chassis crafted from the premium C:68 carbon, it's an extraordinarily race-capable all-rounder that's very nearly as adept at propelling its rider skyward as it is at cashing in gravity credits on the way back down.
Short 435mm chain stays, a head tube designed around a 160mm fork and a steep 75.5-degree seat angle for agile handling and efficient climbing are all part of the package.
We chose Sram's amazing 1x12 Eagle transmission for its simplicity, reliability and awesome gear range, and paired it with powerful Sram G2 RSC hydraulic disc brakes with a 200mm front rotor for the ultimate in stopping power.
Big-volume, super-grippy Maxxis tyres wrapped around light, strong Newmen Evolution wheels are kept in contact with terra firma thanks to a Fox 36 Float Factory fork up front and Float X2 Factory shock at the rear.
Even the Fox Transfer dropper post features a Kashima coating, so you can drop the saddle at the push of a button for better control in super-techy trail situations.
But that's the kind of attention to detail we like to lavish on the bikes, so that you can concentrate on the ride.
And with the Stereo 150 C:68 TM 29 you'll be able to ride every trail, everywhere, faster and smoother.
What do you call a bike that's as rock-solid dependable descending an Alp as it is agile and sure-footed picking a route up the climb the other side of the valley?
There was a time when true mountain-taming descending ability came with a side order of uphill sluggishness.
It wasn't that long ago, and it was enough to make a lot of enduro bikes a frustrating handful.
But that time is now firmly in the past.

Based on the SupTraction Rubber Soul CL (CL for clipless) and with an EVA midsole the Rascal offers much more than uncompromising power transmission onto the pedal: its construction combines stiffness in the longitudinal axis with flexibility in the lateral axis and the upper.
Special dedicated climbing and pedal zones on the tread ensure traction both on and off the pedal.
In addition, the lacing, especially the Serpen Tie (Rascal only), makes sure the upper is perfectly closed, thus adapting to the individual needs and different shapes of the foot.
Toetal Protection (an injected toe cap) and No-Sew Reinforcements absorb and dissipate the forces when the foot hits a rock or roots, protecting both the shoe and its contents.
The asymmetrically shaped upper as well as the Ankle Pad protect the foot on the crank side while still offering full freedom of movement.

Developed during the wettest summer on record the Huggers have been praised by many of the major bike magazines for their simplicity and effectiveness in back to back tests with other mudguards.
Once installed, you will hardly notice that you have installed a mudhugger.
Except maybe that you stay dry and clean longer and can enjoy your tour longer before you end up going back to the pub for your well-deserved, cool beer.
For those of you into your DH, enduro or endurance racing, being able to get out in all weather conditions, train hard and remain comfortable for much longer will undoubtedly pay dividends at the start of the race season.

Pin Tonic Sole Concept:
Do you know the secret of a good drink?
Right, ION´s talking about the correct mixture of ingredients.
With ION’s Raid Amp II flat pedal shoe, it’s pretty much the same story:
To get the best possible performance in terms of grip, power transmission, durability, usability &amp; style, ION relies on a combination of various parameters.
And when looking at the sole, you will see a new concept now mixing a rather soft EVA mid-sole with a soft yet durable rubber blend on the outer sole.
ION calls it Pin Tonic.
On the functional side of things, they mixed in an asymmetrical shaft including the Ankle Pad to add some protection on the crank side.
The sole design still features dedicated pedal and walking zones.
They extend from the ball of the foot to the very end of the mid-foot area.
Toe and heel areas are shaped with particular climb zones to ensure maximum traction off the pedal.
The second main focus in development has been placed on the right mixture of stiffness in the longitudinal axis and flexibility across the lateral axis: a flat-pedal shoe needs to provide power transmission without any compromises in the longitudinal axis during pedalling.
On the lateral axis you need a certain flex to prevent the foot from tilting on the pedal but still allow for effective steering impulses.
And all this while maintaining comfortable foot roll behaviour.
In the toe area a pre-shaped firm toe box protects the foot when it hits rocks or roots.
Super-adhesive yet durable rubber combined with a softer midsole for maximum grip and durability.
ToeTal Protection &amp; Pre-Shaped Heel:
Preformed heel cap for maximum comfort and precise fit.
Guaranteed outstanding heel hold.
Higher inner shaft with additional padding to protect the lower ankle.
Lace Ports:

The Fixie Inc. backspin demonstrates what modern e-mobility can look like in the city.
With the clean look of a singlespeed bike and an electric motor completely hidden inside the rear hub, it will turn heads, amaze you and have fun on your way through the city.
There is no bells and whistles on this wheel:
Here you will find only the essentials you need to get from A to B. This doesn't just look better than wheels overloaded with features and attachments, it also makes your life easier.
The Fixie Inc. backspin accompanies you through thick and thin without any breakdowns because you don't need too complex components.
Drive
If you didn't know, you wouldn't recognize the Zehus drive as such.
The engine, battery and controls are completely housed in the rear hub, and charging is done via a hidden connector in the axle.
The drive has a maximum power rating of 250 watts up to a speed of 25 km/h according to legal regulations.
Backspin
The Zehus app allows you to conveniently control all drive parameters.
The characteristic feature of this wheel is the backspin.
When you step back three times, you activate the drive's charging mode, which allows you to charge the battery while riding.
For example, you can enjoy uphill pedal support and recharge the battery as you roll downhill.
You can also use the app to set a smart recuperation mode that always charges the battery at a certain gradient.
What mountain bikes have been demonstrating for years is also slowly gaining ground on bikes with narrower tyres.
The Fixie Inc. backspin has a longer top tube in combination with a shorter stem for more stability at higher speeds.
The manoeuvrability of the wheel is maintained by the short stem.
So you enjoy a high running smoothness, but can also circulate without great effort around tight curves.
Attachments
In addition to good style, attention was also paid to functionality.
The fork and frame have special pins where you can attach the light and elegant SKS Raceblade mudguards.
So you stay dry when it rains and you can enjoy the minimalistic look of your bike when it stops in no time at all.

The combination of EPS, the polycarbonate shell and the exoskeleton offers the best protection against the mechanical effects of a fall by distributing the energy optimally onto the structure and thus protecting the helmet wearer from the consequences of a fall.
Flow Through Ventilation
Keep your head cool and dry to keep your performance at the highest level.

The Speedrocker was specially developed for gravel bikes, sporty cyclocrossers and racing bikes with comfortable, wider tyres.
The Made in Germany product is not only characterized by its enormous stability, but also scores with its optimal protective effect.
A special feature is the double spoiler function on the front wheel guard, which is fastened with rubberized Velcro straps.
While a spoiler between fork and front wheel first catches the splash water, directs it downwards and presses it onto the tyre through circulation, an additional spoiler catches the water and then sprays it downwards.
The driver stays dry, his face clean.
The rear wheel guard also guarantees perfect splash protection thanks to its extendable profile and is fixed with sturdy rubber straps.

Recognizing that all feet are not the same, the Women’s toesock is designed to better accommodate a female foot, which is typically narrower than a male’s foot, with an increased heel to toe stretch.
The increased two-way stretch will enable the material to better stretch across a female’s foot arch providing compression throughout the foot.
The fit of the individual toe-sleeves were redesigned for a better, snugger fit throughout the toes for female wearers without any excess material.

About Kanzo A
Anything is possible with this bike.
Thanks to its stable geometry, this bike is ideal for long, straight trails.
This bike is probably the most versatile frame platform: the bike can be equipped with mudguards for everyday use, on weekends it invites you to discover gravel roads and it is also well equipped for the occasional long tour with panniers.
Disc brakes
The frame is compatible with 650B (650 x 50) or 700C (700 x 42) wheels and has a 12mm axle in the frame and fork.
Gravel is the new one in the federation and enjoys rapidly increasing popularity.
Is there a better combination than discovering and cycling?
The developers at Ridley don't believe it.
Ridley makes a bike that makes a great mix.
A coincidence?
With a Gravel bike, you can ride any terrain at your own pace.
But why the name Kanzo?
Kanzo, or Canzo, is a term that goes back to the times of the troubadours - singers and poets in the Middle Ages.
They were people who travelled a lot and had all sorts of adventures to make stories about knights and even love stories.
After returning to their village, they told the inhabitants about their adventures.
There were three genres.
The most common was Kanzo/Canzo.
So the troubadours moved whole communities, the people hung on their lips.
Disc brakes are one of the latest pioneering developments in road cycling.
They are equally reliable in all weather conditions.
The ease of braking is a real plus, especially when your hands are ice-cold and hardly able to move.
They give you that extra bit of safety every time you ride, because you know you can stop immediately if you need to.
Just a light pull on the brake lever to reduce speed.
And because no brake pads rub on the rim flanks during braking, wear on the rims is also reduced.
Fortunately, this increases the mileage of your wheelset.
About Kanzo Speed
The Kanzo Speed from Ridley is the perfect solution for those who want to be ahead of the pack in one of the many gravel races that shoot like mushrooms out of the ground.
For example, the 200 mile Dirty Kanza:
We fought to be the first to reach the finish line.
The 36mm tyre clearance is more race-oriented, but leaves plenty of room in the frame, allowing for different configurations and fenders to be fitted.
Thanks to its stable geometry, this bike is a dream to ride on long, straight trails.
Hidden eyelets on the frame and fork for mounting rack and mudguards make the bike look tidy when not in use.
The thru axles on the frame and fork increase the rigidity of the connection between the wheel and the tyre.
Flat-mount disc brakes ensure that you have the wheel under control at all times, both on and off the road.
About the Kanzo range
Ridley Carbon
The developers at Ridley place the highest demands on themselves.
This starts with the selection of raw materials.
They only use the best quality carbon material available from Toray.
Toray is the world's leading carbon manufacturer and primarily supplies the aerospace industry.
Ridley's use of high stiffness carbon varies from the most flexible 24K fabric, which gives the frame flexibility and comfort, to the 60K fabric, the stiffest that they process.
In developing the carbon products, the developers work strictly according to the principle form follows function down to the last detail.
When Ridley develops a frame, they first analyze the exact function it must perform - how it is used, how it must feel in any situation.
They then design the shape of the frame, paying attention to the exact curves, lines, and different thicknesses of each tube.
Finally comes the carbon scrim.
Combining the carbon qualities to get the right feel from the bike is like assembling the most complicated 3D puzzle game.
Usually there are hundreds of carbon pieces that are assembled in several dozen layers.
Once this puzzle is complete, you have a piece that is perfectly suited to your future task.
Each one of the carbon bikes is an example of this extreme attention to detail.
About the Kanzo
The Kanzo is the Ridley Gravel bike that meets the needs of the ever-growing Gravel market.
The tyre clearance (700 x 47 mm) makes this frame future-proof.
For an extreme sense of adventure, you can even lift the wheel up to 50 mm by using the 650B wheels and tyres.
Additional bottle mounts on the fork, top tube and down tube give you the flexibility you need to transport bottles while stowing all your remaining luggage in the bike bags.
By fitting a luggage rack or mudguard, this bike can easily be transformed into a true bikepacking machine.
The flex zones in the rear struts provide extra comfort by filtering the vibrations from various surfaces you encounter on your adventures.

Ok... there is a fair amount of anti-squat built into the horst-link design - this is especially important for use with 1X drivetrains.
The 2017 Snabbs now feature one piece rocker arm keeps the already very rigid rear triangle even stiffer.
It drives the new generation of shocks from Sram with a trunion mount - longer, bigger, better.
The combination of the new shocks and rocker arms result in a more linear suspension curve and overall smoother functioning of the system.
The geometry is modern, low, long and slack.
We know that NS Bikes customers are usually tough, aggressive riders and expect our products to hold up to seasons of abuse.
That is why the frames are built to DH racing standards in both alloy and carbon versions and run on high-end MAX bearings for prolonged periods of smooth, service free use.

Shimano's first groupset for gravel riding.
Instead of telling gravel riders what they need, Shimano's developers asked them what they wanted.
Shimano has listened for two years and spent countless hours talking to gravel enthusiasts from all over the world.
They rode on dust and gravel roads and narrow tracks, and crossed streams and mountain passes to get an idea of what a Shimano Gravel group could look like.
The result of all these trips and new friendships?
First the Shimano Gravel Alliance and now the Shimano GRX - the world's first groupsets with components specially developed for gravel.
The goal is not to dominate the gravel scene or even change its direction.
Shimano didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
The engineers at Shimano love gravel just the way it is.
Shimano simply wanted to give you and your friends the opportunity to ride the way you want with its new groupset.
And last but not least, the developers envisioned a Shimano GRX groupset that would deliver top performance for gravel racing and at the same time offer options that make it affordable for cost-conscious riders.
By setting these design goals, Shimano have developed components that are also suitable for cyclocross, bike adventures and almost any similar type of cycling.
Simply put, the Shimano GRX is the world's best way to move freely and discover new territory on your gravel bike.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the rugged landscape and abundant precipitation of Canada’s Pacific Coast is the ultimate place to develop and perfect a carbon fibre cyclocross bike.
The Nicasio series lets you take any path you'd like, whether it is on the asphalt or up a gravel road with a secret view.
And the list of manufacturers of the rest of the equipment also reads like the who's who of the components scene:
A new frame construction and the Gravity Casting manufacturing process in combination with a low centre of gravity promise a maximum of stability and riding comfort.
The RONDO RUUT AL2 is a great, budget-friendly all-rounder: whether as a training bike for the winter, as a commuter bike or simply as a gravel bike.
The light and robust aluminium frame convinces not only by specific shapes, but also by a very good reactivity and cables running inside.
TwinTip - Fork
The Ruut AL2 is equipped with the typical RONDO TwinTip fork, which allows you to adapt the geometry of the bike to your individual preferences and the terrain you want to ride.
All necessary rack and fender mounts are included, so this bike has an enormous range of applications.
The RUUT AL2 components have been carefully selected and tested for reliability in winter on the most demanding Polish muddy battlefields.
These include the hydraulic disc brakes that Rondo has been using in their own bikes for several seasons and the reliable Sram Apex single drive in combination with an FSA crankset and mud resistant WTB nano tyres.
This position gives the bike a higher front end and a longer trail and room for the large tires or mudguards .
Ideal for long distances, hard conditions during training or racing.
This position lowers the cockpit, gives you a steep steering angle and leads to a shorter distance.
Perfect when you're ready to kick some people in the ass.
The royal class, the Ortler Perigor Pinion 9, embodies sovereignty and simple elegance without any platitude.
Representative, but not for the purpose of self-representation, but to elevate its driver to the king of the country road.
The Ortler Perigor Pinion 9 is continuity and modernity in one.
The heart of the Ortler Perigor Pinion 9 is its encapsulated central gearbox - the Pinion C1.9.
The 9-speed gearbox represents an engineering masterpiece made in Germany.
Built for eternity, it offers a maximum of low maintenance and durability, with a total transmission ratio of 568% and a transmission weight of 2000 g.

The C-line not only blends seamlessly into the frame design, it is also the heart of the modern Ortler Perigor .
The new design consistently pursues the goal of merging drive and bicycle.
The C-Line transmissions are the smallest and most powerful central transmission ever.
The new, compact housing is 33% lighter than aluminium.
Highly developed manufacturing processes and highest precision allow the use of an ultra-light magnesium alloy.
Of course 100 % made in Germany.
<>Enduring Ergonomic
Whether it's a daily sprint to the office or a long weekend bike trip, the C-Line is the right companion.
The biomechanically optimal support distance (Q-factor) of only 166 millimetres allows sporty and at the same time healthy cycling, because the pedalling force is introduced into the bike in line with the body axis.
<>Central unit
The design of the new C-Line focuses on optimum integration into modern bicycle frames.
This includes the fact that the train guide adapts to the frame design in 3 positions.
Brake lines or electric cables can also be routed invisibly past the transmission to the rear end.

The lights are connected to a low-maintenance hub dynamo and the seven-speed hub gears also do their job without any problems.
Mudguards and a luggage rack are also included.
With the Vermont Woodbury, children can also get a bit of retro chic.
Optical highlights include the paintwork as well as the colour-matched tyres, grips and saddle.
But the bike has much more to offer than just a pretty appearance.
The frame is made of aluminium and therefore pleasantly light.
As befits a real Dutch bike, the Woodbury has a 3-speed hub gear with coaster brake and chain guard.
In contrast to classic Dutch bikes, the bike also offers various other refinements, such as the lighting system with hub dynamo.
A rear rack is a matter of course, the basket on the handlebar doubles the carrying capacity of the bike - and makes it even prettier.

Some people will tell you that one bike can't do it all.
All we can say is, they clearly haven't tried the Cross Allroad.
Blending the sophisticated frame design of the Cross series with the added functionality of full-length mudguards and a built-in rear light and hub dynamo, this is a bike that's capable of tackling everything from the daily commute to extended weekend excursions.
Shimano's slick, reliable 10-speed transmission is backed by the powerful all-weather stopping ability of hydraulic disc brakes and the comfort of a Suntour suspension fork.
All roads, all weather, all seasons, all purposes: the Cross Allroad is the bike for all reasons.
When they set out to design the Cross's aluminium frame, the engineers set themselves an ambitious goal: to increase efficiency, stability and riding comfort, all whilst reducing weight.
That's why you'll find technologies in the Cross frame that ordinarily belong in much more expensive bikes.
A tapered head tube improves steering precision, while cables routed inside the down tube help keep your gears shifting smoothly for longer, with minimal maintenance.
Whether it's the Smooth Welding technology CUBE employed to improve the appearance of frame joints or the sleek, double-butted aluminium tubes and neatly integrated luggage carrier and mudguard mounts, everything is here to improve both function and looks.
Speed can be addictive - and all the more so when it's achieved under your own power.
Speed can be addictive - and all the more so when it's achieved under your own power.
The Attain Race has all the attributes of a fast road bike - nimble handling, efficient power delivery and a great selection of reliable components - with the added comfort of a frame that's designed with longer rides in mind.
You can thank features like the slim, flat seat stays and large-diameter, cross-ovalised down tube for that.
And the full carbon fork adds even more to the comfortable ride, while subtracting a healthy chunk of weight.
We know the whole lot is safe and durable, because CUBE tested it in the own 24/7 test lab.
All that's left for you to do is to figure out where you're going to ride next.
Ride solo or ride with your mates... this is a bike that'll have you coming back for more.
The Acid 240 Disc is the bike that all youngsters will want.
Shimano's 2x10-speed Tiagra gears put the right ratio for any road literally at your fingertips, while powerful mechanical disc brakes offer the peace of mind of consistent, controllable braking in any weather conditions. the engineers carefully finessed the profile of every frame tube to arrive at the ideal blend of efficient power transfer, intuitive handling and surprising comfort, even on rough roads.
From the organic appearance of the Smooth Welding joints at the tapered head tube to the low-maintenance internal cable routing and RILink compatible carrier mounts, every detail is designed to enhance comfort, strength, durability and appearance.
Light, grippy and comfortable CUBE tyres - and a cool, radially-spoked front wheel - complete the package.
Take a really close look at the Agree Hybrid C:62 Race, because it's not quite what it seems.
Sure, it's an elegant, carbon-framed road bike in the tradition of elegant, carbon-framed road bikes.
But it's also a technical marvel - a sophisticated e-bike that represents an entirely new way to ride on the road.
Sometimes you'll find a surprise hiding within plain sight.
Working seamlessly with Shimano's iconic 105 2x11 transmission, it's capable of extending your range, flattening out the climbs and opening up a whole world of new riding possibilities. the premium C:62 carbon and Advanced Twin Mold construction enabled the engineers to create this miracle of clever packaging, while front and rear thru axles and a carbon bladed fork with tapered steerer contribute to a torsionally rigid structure, so pedal response is instantaneous and steering is accurate and intuitive.
Shimano 105 hydraulic disc brakes with Continental Grand Sport Race SL tyres put you in full control on even the longest descents, and a comfortable Selle Royal saddle rounds out a package that combines value with completely dependable performance.
Open your eyes, take a leap of faith and see what possibilities the open road brings...
It's not particularly tricky to attach a battery pack and a motor to a bike these days, if you don't care about looks.
But the engineers are always looking to make things better - and, to them, the idea of an ugly road bike was simply anathema.
So the Agree Hybrid C:62 represented a very particular challenge: combine the elegant simplicity of a road race machine with the incredible performance potential of a pedal-assist e-bike system.
Using the premium C:62 carbon and Advanced Twin Mold construction technique, they succeeded in fully enclosing the drive unit and battery in an elegant down tube, so most people won't even notice you're riding an e-bike.
And of course, we routed cables internally to match the frame's clean looks and reduce the need for maintenance.
Because once you've tried the Agree Hybrid C:62, there's only thing you'll want to do: ride.
And then ride some more.

That's why we created the AMS 100 C:68 SLT 29 - to get you another few pedal revolutions closer to the podium.
Simple: by starting with the proven four-bar suspension system and refining every detail. the best C:68 carbon is finessed into the lightest, stiffest structure possible using the own Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing technique for the optimum blend of high strength, low weight and unbeatable durability.
From the hidden pivots and sleek rocker design to the tapered head tube and Boost rear end, every aspect is honed to perfection.
Sram's light, slick and precise XX1 wireless Eagle AXS 1x12 transmission transfers your power to the stiff, agile Newmen Advanced carbon wheelset.
Sleek, featherweight Newmen carbon cockpit components keep you on track.
But a frame this good is only as good as the weakest component - so we selected only the very best.
And Kashima-coated Fox suspension ensures that every race course undulation is ironed out.
If there's a faster, lighter, more efficient and more reliable cross-country race bike out there, CUBE yet to see it.

Everything CUBE learnt during that time has gone into this frame.
From the Boost 148 rear end and tapered head tube - which contribute to the AMS 100's superlative pedalling efficiency and uncannily accurate steering - to the superlight C:68 carbon construction and Advanced Twin Mold technology, everything about this frame serves one purpose: to make it the fastest way to get from A to B cross country.
Stealth dropper post compatibility makes for a simple upgrade, internal cable routing keeps gear shifts clean even on the muddiest of race courses, and the super-clean appearance is given a helping hand by hiding bolts and pivots away.

27.5 + WHEELS
A lot has changed since we built the first Stereo full-suspension bike.
But that's OK, because there's nothing the engineers enjoy more than the challenge of producing a better bike than the one they did before.
At CUBE we never, ever rest on the laurels.
Which brings us neatly to the Stereo 150 C:62 SL 29 - a bike that condenses everything we know about building light, fast and versatile bikes into a sleek, elegant and hard-hitting all-rounder for the enduro enthusiast and Alpine-addicted.
With its elegant C:62 carbon chassis and ample clearance for big-volume 29er tyres, the design team left nothing to chance.
ISCG05 tabs for a chain guide are standard, cables are all routed internally for long-lasting clean shifting, and the whole chassis is designed to accommodate 160mm of fork travel.
In the case of the Stereo 150 C:62 SL 29, that particular duty falls to a Fox 36 Float Factory fork, paired with a matching Fox Float DPX2 Factory shock at the rear for seemingly bottomless, smooth and progressive rock-swallowing performance.
There's also a Fox Transfer Factory dropper post with remote control, so you can tuck the saddle out of the way on particularly tricky trail sections.
The light, stiff XT crank works seamlessly with Shimano's new 12-speed components to deliver a huge 510% gear range, while four-piston XT hydraulic disc callipers at both ends give you the power you'll need to keep your speed safely in check.
It all rolls on Newmen's light, stiff and amazingly strong Evolution wheelset, shod with Schwalbe's Addix tyres for the ultimate in grip and cushioning in any trail conditions.
However steep the mountainside, however tough the trail, this bike's got your back.
And the components are designed to be durable, reliable and easy to use.
So there's an easily adjustable Suntour suspension fork and matching rear shock, to smooth out the trail ahead of you.
We selected Sram's legendary 1x12 Eagle transmission for its incredible gear range and ease of use.
And powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with grippy Schwalbe tyres ensure you're always in full control, no matter how wet and muddy the trail gets.
From a short trail centre spin to a long day out in the mountains, you'll be surprised how much 120mm of rear suspension can open up new horizons.
And, with the clever Size Split system, every rider can find her perfect fit.
What's stopping you?
What the engineers don't know about designing great full-suspension bikes could be written on the back of a postage stamp.
That's how CUBE been able to give the Sting 120 all the features it needs to excel out on the trail.
From the triple-butted 7005 series aluminium Superlite tubes - for low weight and excellent stiffness - to the Agile Ride Geometry's quick, intuitive handling, everything here serves a purpose.
A Boost axle at the rear and 15mm up front complement the tapered steerer tube for better steering accuracy and tracking on rough trails and, as you'd expect, cables are routed internally for low maintenance and to preserve the frame's stunning good looks.
And that complex-profile top tube doesn't just look good, it also improves standover clearance for better handling, greater stiffness and lower weight.
That's why, for 2020, we completely redesigned the Sting WS EXC's frame.
A new kind of driver is emerging - one that loves freedom and exploration, on which the Gravel culture was founded, but which feels the hunger to drive wild, to let off steam and not only to explore geography but also personal boundaries.
Want to keep chipping away at your personal best?
Then you'll like the Axial WS GTC SL - the ideal bike any rider who appreciates how great equipment can help bring out her best performance.
Its carbon frame, precision manufactured using the Twin Mold technology and tested to destruction in the 24/7 test lab to confirm its strength and durability, has an ideal stiffness-to-weight ratio.
From the oversized main frame tubes to the 12mm rear axle and reinforced head tube area, the frame's rigid backbone transfers all your efforts to the light, stiff and strong Fulcrum wheelset.
Meanwhile the carbon fork and slender seat stays help filter out tiring vibrations, so you can continue to ride at your best late into the day.
Smooth, wide-ranging Shimano Ultegra gears put the perfect ratio for any road at your fingertips, while powerful Shimano 105 hydraulic disc brakes offer confidence-enhancing all-weather performance.
Light, fast and comfortable:
The Axial WS GTC SL is all three of these things, perfected.

Inimitable
Specifically tuned for all-mountain needs, the F.O.L.D suspension design serves up an optimally balanced mix of stability and sensitivity.
Fun-packed
Thanks to the compact design of the Shimano E8000 motor and Focus battery, Focus were able to create a modern, agile and aggressive geometry for the JAM².
This ensures that you have just as much fun on the trail as with their JAM without assistance.
Featuring triple butting and complex hydroforming to shave weight wherever possible and ensure strength where it's needed, it's more than just mountain bike eye candy.
The sleek looks disguise practical features like hidden suspension pivots and internal cable routing, for reduced maintenance.
Revised geometry makes it more trail-capable and intuitive to handle than ever before, so you can concentrate on enjoying the ride.
At CUBE we're great believers in the adage that you shouldn't always judge a book by its cover.
That's why, with the AMS 100 C:68 TM 29, CUBE combined the race-ready speed of the AMS 100 platform with trail-tough components like a 120mm travel Fox 34 Float Factory fork, Fox Transfer Factory remote dropper post and wider-profile Newmen Evolution rims shod with grippy, big-volume 2.35in tyres.
The result is a bike that doesn't just look fast, but is capable of taking even the most demanding of trails - or race courses - apart and reassembling them in smooth, easily digestible chunks of flat-out fun.
Add Sram's stunning Eagle 1x12 drivetrain and powerful Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes, and you've got a trail-devouring machine that's tough to beat.
The low weight, incredible stiffness and efficient kinematics of the AMS 100 chassis are a key part of this bike's stunning performance.
Using the proven potential of the four-bar linkage suspension and packaging it around the proprietary C:68 carbon construction, the designers have succeeded in combining low weight, ground-hugging comfort and control, and incredible rigidity for accurate steering and on-demand acceleration.
From the tapered steerer to the Boost rear end and elegant rocker, it's a bike that delivers on the promise of its looks.
Carbon-framed efficiency, race course-bred speed and trail-capable components: it's the CUBE Trail Motion creed.
Balance is key to learning to ride, but once you're there... the urge to pedal and move faster won't be far behind.
That's why we created the Cubie 120 - for kids who can't wait to power themselves.
A lightweight aluminium frame and fork has allowed us to build a smaller, perfectly formed bike that's clearly a mini version of mum and dad's bikes.
The tough 6061 aluminium chassis is built to handle the rough and tumble of exploratory play, and the engineers paid particular attention to ensuring that all edges and corners are as smooth as possible to help reduce the chance of injury.
A coaster brake at the rear and light, smooth rim brake at the front - with a lever designed specifically for small hands - makes it safe and easy to slow down and stop, even for the most enthusiastic of youngsters.
There's a built-in rear mudguard, a Hebie Chainlooper to protect your little one's legs from the transmission, and the saddle features an easy carry handle for those times when it all gets a bit too much and mum or dad has to carry the bike home.
If there's a better way to learn to pedal, have fun and build confidence at the same time, we don't know what it is.
There's just as much care and attention in one of these little bikes as there is in any of the adult models.
The tough, lightweight 6061 aluminium frame and fork are built to handle the rough and tumble of exploratory play.
They're also perfectly proportioned and designed for easy, safe handling.
CUBE kept edges and corners as smooth as possible to help reduce the risk of injury and, of course, the Cubie 120 is available in a choice of frame finishes to suit every child.
Ride more, whatever that means for you.
Big days out in big country demand a bike that's up to the task.
Borrowing technology we developed partly out of experience born from racing mountain bikes on some of the planet's most challenging trails, the Sting WS 140 HPC Race doesn't hold back in helping you get the best out of your trail riding.
The carbon main frame is available in sizes right down to 13.5 inch, which means every rider should be able to find her perfect fit.
The tapered head tube and refined geometry are designed to cater specifically for a 150mm fork and, like all the frames, it's flown through the torture-testing processes of the own in-house, 24/7 test lab.

The SL tag isn't one that we dish out lightly.
In the case of the brand-new Reaction Hybrid SL, the combination of the completely redesigned aluminium frame and a selection of light, smooth and desirable components means that it's thoroughly earned.
More than just an object of beauty, it's a design marvel in its own right - and more desirable than ever, thanks to the fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit. the engineering team started from scratch with this bike, developing an all-new Modular Battery System which houses the power unit inside a custom-designed, gravity cast down tube, out of the way of dust, dirt and water.
It also enables the use of an even higher capacity battery, meaning that you can ride further and for longer than ever before.
Details like the 1.5in head tube, oversized chain stays and Boost rear axle ensure that every watt of the Bosch drive unit's power is efficiently transferred to the rear wheel, while revised Agile Ride Geometry designed around the 120mm RockShox Recon air fork serves up the ideal blend of agility when you want it, and stability when you need it.
There's even provision for an easy stealth dropper post upgrade, should your riding ambitions demand it.
Powerful Magura hydraulic disc brakes - with a 203mm rotor at the front for even more power under prolonged, heavy braking - and extra-wide, grippy Schwalbe tyres ensure you're always in complete control.
And, of course, the smooth and seamless Bosch CX drive unit and Kiox controller deliver pedal-enhancing torque to the rear wheel via Sram's NX Eagle 12-speed transmission.
It all means you've got the range, power and control to ride wherever your curiosity takes you - and keep coming back for more.

Ultra-neat rack and mudguard mounting points maintain the Touring ONE's clean looks whilst allowing us to kit it out with a full complement of accessories from kickstand to chain guard and integrated lighting system, so it'll easily take on any role.
We're proud of the Aerium triathlon bikes.
Well, CUBE thought of that too.
They're the fastest of their kind on the market, and that's testament to the efforts of the engineers.
But what if you want to race time trials on a UCI-compliant machine?
Meet the all new Aerium C:68 TT - a wind-cheating, PB-busting race bike designed to be the fastest a UCI frame can possibly be.
Although it's based on the experience and technology we used to develop the Aerium, the TT is a completely fresh design from the bottom bracket up.
Working with the UCI regulations to ensure full compliance, the engineers began with a completely new set of Computer Fluid Dynamics calculations, then tested the results in the wind tunnel.
The Aerium C:68 TT is your chance to shine.
Take it.
Pedal hard.
And win.
There are two ways to build a really ærodynamic frame.
The first involves ignoring all the rules, and just seeing where the science leads you.
The result of that approach is the Aerium - still, in the testing, the world's fastest triathlon frame.
But if you want to race under the auspices of the UCI, a different approach is needed.
Building on the Aerium's successes, we wanted to build an ærodynamic machine that could be raced at the highest level.
So we broke out the UCI rulebook, had a careful think, did a whole lot of very advanced Computer Fluid Dynamics modelling, and put the resulting designs in the wind tunnel for extensive testing.
The result is the frame you see here - fully UCI compliant, as ærodynamically smooth as it's possible to make a time trial frame, incredibly light and unbelievably efficient.
Using the C:68 carbon and Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing, the engineers were able to craft a chassis that's both very slippery and torsionally rigid, so every watt of your pedalling makes a noticeable difference to your speed.
It's inspirational.
And very, very fast.
Every single profile of the frame has been changed from the original Aerium, and all in the pursuit of ultimate speed. the C:68 carbon is crafted into a structure that's light, stiff and cuts through the air like a hot knife through butter.
Fast-rolling Schwalbe tyres keep you glued to the tarmac, and Shimano's reliable and slick-shifting Ultegra Di2 Disc groupset gives you both motive and stopping power to spare.
Because, when you've put in the time to train, refined your technique and ride position and watched what you eat, the last thing you need is for your bike to let you down.
What do you need in an adventure touring bike?
We made the own list and built the Kathmandu SL around it: light, stiff, strong, versatile, reliable and, above all, comfortable.
The IC 2.0 luggage rack combines with the aluminium Superlite frame to make a formidable load-carrying companion for any adventure, big or small.
Double-butted tubing removes weight from areas where it's safe to do so, and adds material where it's needed for strength.
Combined with the Efficient Comfort Geometry, the result is a sublimely smooth ride that'll have you eating up the miles and coming back for more.
And the integrated design of the carrier isn't just elegant - it's also exceptionally strong, stiff and stable.
Wear components can be easily replaced and it even features a built-in rear light.
Full-length mudguards, a kickstand and powerful all-weather hydraulic disc brakes round out the Kathmandu SL.
If there's a better way of seeing the world from a saddle, CUBE yet to find it...
Whatever you do, wherever you go, the Touring Hybrid ONE will get you there in comfort and style. the affordable, adaptable hybrid tourer has everything you need to make riding your Bosch e-bike a pleasure.
Whether you opt for the Easy Entry, Trapeze or Men's version, the engineers have carefully crafted the frame to ensure seamless integration of the Bosch drive unit and battery.
They're in the optimum position for safe handling and sleek good looks so that, combined with the Efficient Comfort Geometry, you can rest assured that the Touring Hybrid ONE will be safe and easy to handle - and, like every CUBE bike, it's passed all the in-house lab tests.
Smooth-shifting, easy-to-use Shimano 9-speed gears work flawlessly with Bosch's system to make every journey a breeze - and the internal cable routing ensures that the shifts will stay smooth and reliable for a long time to come, with minimal maintenance.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes offer predictable stopping in all weathers and the mudguards, lighting system, kickstand and luggage carrier ensure you're fully equipped for any eventuality.
Just jump on and ride...
Affordable it may be, but compromise isn't a word that the engineers understand.
That's why every version of the Touring Hybrid ONE - Easy Entry, Trapeze and Men's - has been lavished with the same attention to detail, including the Smooth Welding process and internally routed cables for reduced maintenance.
Star of the show, of course, is the Bosch drive system and battery pack, which have been optimally sited in every frame version to keep the bike's centre of gravity low.
That's important because, combined with the Efficient Comfort Geometry, it gives the Touring Hybrid ONE the kind of confidence-inspiring handling that'll you'll love straight away.
Are you ready?
Its hydroformed, triple-butted tubeset with 157mm rear hub spacing weighs only slightly more than an Enduro frame, but delivers extraordinary steering precision and epic rock-swallowing ability.
The four-bar suspension design has similar suspension characteristics to the super-efficient trail bikes, but with noticeably better agility and control than some simpler DH designs.
It's both lighter than you'd expect and reassuringly bomb-proof.
Lower weight makes it easier to handle, and better handling translates to more speed... and more speed is what it's all about, right?
Backing up this no-nonsense frame design is a premium crop of components to give the Two15 SL the competitive edge it deserves.
A RaceFace cockpit combines with Sram's GX DH 7-speed transmission and Magura MT7 hydraulic disc brakes to put you firmly in control.
A light, tough DT Swiss wheelset is wrapped in Schwalbe's Magic Mary tyres to provide you with the grip and control that you need, while a Fox 40/49 Factory fork and matching Float X2 Factory shock keep the rubber side down, no matter how hard you shred.
Because the Two15 SL most certainly is...
Because the Two15 SL most certainly is...
Hands up who thinks that downhill and bike park bikes are ungainly, heavy and inefficient?
Yeah, we thought so.
If that's your opinion, you haven't met the Two15.
But we didn't stop with the kinematics, because the engineers also put a lot of effort into reducing weight.
The Two15's hydroformed, triple-butted tubeset with 157mm rear hub spacing weighs only a bit more than an enduro frame, but delivers extraordinary steering precision and epic rock-swallowing capability.
And details like the internal cable routing are the icing on the cake, delivering millimetre-perfect gear shifts every time, in even the worst riding conditions.
And details like the internal cable routing are the icing on the cake, delivering millimetre-perfect gear shifts every time, in even the worst riding conditions.
Take on gravity, and show it who's boss...
Smooth Welding is as durable as it is sleek, and the carbon-bladed fork helps filter out high-frequency vibrations for even greater comfort.
We even routed cables internally - neat, tidy and secure - for reduced maintenance and improved gear-shifting performance.
Head out into the country or across town - either way, you'll want to be aboard the SL Road Race.
One bike to do it all: is that even possible?
If you have to ask the question, you've clearly not met the Access WS Allroad - a bike that's both a Jack of all trades and a master of them, too.
Starting with all the benefits of the rugged, reliable and comfortable Access, we added mudguards, a built-in kickstand and a set of lights.
The result is a true off-roader that'll slot right into your busy life by tackling the trip across town, too.
It's got the same carefully tailored geometry, women-specific rider contact points and reliable, easy-to-use components as its little sister.
With powerful all-weather mechanical disc brakes and the added comfort and control of a Suntour suspension fork, you've got the perfect package for exploring off-road... or wherever your curiosity leads you.
See?
It's all in the detail.
But you already knew that.
Podium places and personal bests don't just happen - they need to be earned.
But it's not just about blood, sweat and gears... it's also about having the right bike for the job.
That's why we developed the Agree C:62 SLT.
It's an uncompromisingly light, stiff, and surprisingly comfortable endurance race bike that will allow any rider to push their limits.
Featuring Sram's Force eTap AXS wireless 2x12 transmission with compact chainrings, its seamless gear shifts and wide gear ratio range will help you extract as much speed as possible from your efforts on the pedals.
Newmen Advanced SL R.38 æro-carbon wheels and cockpit components seal the competitive edge, and Continental's Grand Prix 5000 tyres grip tenaciously to the road.
But the centrepiece of this remarkable bike is, of course, the frame.
Front and rear wheels feature 12mm thru-axles for improved stiffness, while the complex-profiled down tube and chain stays build into an incredibly efficient structure.
Specially shaped seat stays and carbon fork blades keep the Agree C:62 SLT's rider comfortable for the long haul, and the integrated seat clamp is one of the neat touches that helps improve ærodynamics.
Which is why, whether you're chasing a personal best or an end-of-season trophy, this is a bike that'll help get you there.
And now CUBE improved it even more, by equipping it with a brand-new carbon main frame for even lower weight and exceptional efficiency, without sacrificing the comfort and reliability for which this bike is known.
Internal cable routing, hidden rocker pivots and the proven Efficient Trail Control kinematics combined with Agile Trail Geometry all add up to a bike that is, in many ways, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
From the slick, sleek and reliable Shimano XT brakes and 1x12 transmission to the Fox 34 Factory fork and DPS Factory shock - both with Kashima coatings for the ultimate in bump sensitivity - CUBE selected only the best parts to pair with the design team's latest masterpiece.
A Fox Transfer Factory remote dropper post for those tricky, technical descents and a light, stiff e*thirteen carbon crankset with Newmen Evolution wheels complete the setup.
Whether you like to ride multi-day adventures or just enjoy exploring singletrack on your home turf, the Stereo 120 SLT 29 has got your back.
Advanced Twin Mold technology allowed them to create a fast trail bike that blends low weight, ground-hugging control and supreme efficiency.
RockShox suspension technology - with a Boost rear end, tapered steerer and thru-axle fork - keeps both wheels glued to the trail for the ultimate in forward propulsion and steering accuracy, with a full 120mm of travel up front.
Newmen cockpit components and a CUBE 130mm dropper post make tackling tricky trail obstacles a breeze, while Shimano's 12-speed transmission and hydraulic disc brakes - with 4-piston front calliper - deliver precise power exactly when you need it.
Big-volume Schwalbe tyres on a Fulcrum Red 55 wheelset round off the package.
Add it all up and it's everything the you could wish for in a bike built to get from A to B via the most fun trails, as fast as possible.
There are times when more really is more.
More travel, more versatility more possibilities.
Completely redesigned for 2020, the Stereo Hybrid HPC 140 Race takes everything CUBE learnt about building mountain-taming e-bikes, and re-packages it into a 29er Bosch e-bike that's even more capable.
You'd probably guess from the RockShox Deluxe Select trunnion-mount shock and RockShox 35 Gold fork that we're serious about its suspension capabilities, and you'd be right.
Larger, more durable bearings and a Boost 148 rear end help make this the best-performing all-mountain e-bike to date, helped along by the Agile Trail Geometry and Efficient Trail Control kinematics.
But that's just part of the story.
The all-new, full carbon front triangle is full of neat touches like a semi-integrated seat clamp, integrated cable routing and one-screw drive unit cover.
But star of the show is the new Modular Battery System, which houses the Bosch power unit securely completely within the oversized down tube, protected from the elements with a shock-absorbing cover.
And there's still room for a bottle cage mount, too.
This new system isn't just incredibly easy to use - with a push-button release and hidden lock - but also enabled the engineers to create enough space for an optional larger battery, for extended range.
Sram's trend-setting SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain helps transfer the fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit's power to the rear wheel, while powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes - with an oversized 203mm rotor up front - work with Schwalbe's comfy, super-grippy 2.6in Nobby Nic tyres to give you all the control you need.
And, because a bike like this is going to inspire you to do more, we even fitted a remote dropper post - so you can explore new lines.
It all adds up to a compelling reason to get out into the mountains and ride.
Will you rise to the challenge?
Mountain bike hybrid versatility has a new name, and that name is Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC.
Built around Bosch's new, fourth-generation drive system and drawing on the extensive experience of hybrid power, carbon frame construction and efficient suspension kinematics, it represents a new breed of all-mountain e-MTBs. the engineering team developed a brand-new concept for this frame, building the CUBE Modular Battery System to hide the Bosch power unit completely inside the sleek carbon down tube.
A tough cover provides protection and shock absorption for the battery, whilst push-button access and a hidden lock make it both easy to use and secure from unwelcome attention.
Even better, the new system frees up enough space for the option of a higher capacity battery than before, which translates to extended range and longer days out in the mountains.
The fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit sits in its own housing, while the aluminium rear triangle features a Boost 148 axle for efficient power transfer, larger bearings for longer life and a linkage designed to fit a trunnion shock. the All Mountain Geometry is specifically designed to work with the suspension kinematics and Bosch drive system, offering handling that only the fully integrated design is capable of doing - stable, confidence-inspiring and fun.
And of course it's chain guide compatible, there's a bottle cage mount for carrying tools or water, and integrated cable routing ensures that gears carry on shifting smoothly with minimal maintenance.
Shimano's electronic DuraAce Di2 transmission, with completely concealed cables, works seamlessly with the Fazua drive system to deliver incredibly smooth gear shifts and quiet, smooth pedal assistance.
All mountain versatility, redefined: that's the Stereo Hybrid HPC 140.
By enclosing the sophisticated, removable Fazua drive unit and battery entirely within the down tube, the engineering team succeeded in creating a stiff and strong backbone - but, just as importantly, one that also looks stunning.
Because who wants to spend time fiddling with their bike, when another day in the mountains beckons?
With clearance for tyres up to 35mm and the reassurance of Shimano's powerful DuraAce hydraulic disc brakes and their all-weather stopping ability, it's a nimble and powerful companion that'll redefine your expectations of road biking.
Almost effortless climbing and extended range are just two of the benefits - and if you decide you'd prefer to ride without assistance, the drive system is completely removable.
A carbon fork, Newmen cockpit components and wheels and Natural Fit saddle round out a remarkable package of wish-list components.
Part technological masterpiece, part object of desire... and a new classic to add to the pantheon of beautiful road bikes.
There's absolutely nothing in the world that the design team likes more than to be let loose on a bike with a brief to simply build the best.
And here, in the new Stereo Hybrid HPC SLT, we have one of the results: the ultimate expression of all-mountain performance in a 29er Bosch e-bike, with absolutely no expense spared.
With 140mm of travel at the front from the superbly plush RockShox Pike Ultimate fork and 140mm at the rear, courtesy of the equally smooth and progressive RockShox Deluxe Ultimate trunnion-mount shock, there's barely a mountain trail that can't be ridden on this bike.
The light, strong and rigid Newman Advanced SL carbon wheelset, shod with grippy and comfortable Schwalbe Hans Dampf 2.6in tyres, transfers the fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit's power - and your pedalling input - to the ground via Sram's incredible X01 Eagle AXS wireless 12-speed gears.
Whatever the climb, however steep the challenge, this is a bike that's up for it.
And, coming back down, you've the reassurance of the RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post, RaceFace cockpit components and super-powerful Magura MT Trail Carbon hydraulic disc brakes with oversized 203mm rotors for better cooling.
But it isn't just about the components, because the Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC SLT also features the completely redesigned all-mountain e-bike chassis with carbon main frame, revised kinematics and tweaked Agile Trail Geometry for rock-solid handling in any situation.
We're particularly proud of the Modular Battery System and its shock-absorbing, dust- and moisture-resistant cover with push-button release and hidden lock.
It doesn't just hide the Bosch power unit away inside the sleek down tube, it also enabled the designers to fit a larger capacity battery for extended range - and leave room for a bottle cage mount.
It's this kind of attention to detail that makes the CUBE difference, and means you can rely on your Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC SLT in the mountains.
However tough the trail, it'll be there for you.
Will you accept the challenge?
All Mountain versatility, redefined: that's the Stereo Hybrid HPC 140.
Light, strong, efficient - that's the way we roll.
With the peerless performance of Shimano XT 3x10 gears and a RockShox Paragon Gold air suspension fork, it's quite possibly the ultimate grand tourer.
That's why we started with the advanced aluminium double-butted frame with a sleek rigid fork and hidden rack and mudguard mounts.
Lightweight, incredibly efficient and superbly practical, like all the frames it's been through the 24/7 torture-testing lab to verify its strength, durability and safety.
We didn't compromise on the transmission, selecting Shimano's superb Alfine 11-speed hub gear and combining it with a Gates belt drive for silent running and practical low-maintenance performance.
The eccentric bottom bracket makes belt tension adjustment a cinch and we guarantee you won't miss an oily chain.
Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes offer reliable stopping even when the weather isn't cooperating.
There are even two bottle cage mounts, so you can stay hydrated if your Editor tempts you into a longer excursion at the weekends.
Because after all, one of the beauties of an ultra-efficient urban bike is that it also makes it easier to escape the city...
CUBE's engineers took everything they'd learned from building fast, lightweight mountain bike frames and put it to good use in the Editor.
An eccentric bottom bracket enables belt tension to be adjusted easily, and ultra-neat mudguard and luggage carrier mounts enable the easy addition of these accessories without spoiling the clean lines of your bike.
And the sleek, lightweight fork performs as good as it looks, giving precise and nimble steering and a surprising degree of comfort on rough city streets.
When we set out to design the Stereo 140 HPC Race we had a simple goal - to build a bike that would redefine expectations of an all-mountain machine.
Light, nimble and versatile almost beyond your imagination, its carbon main frame and rocker, combined with an aluminium rear triangle and 150mm fork, is capable of taking you to places you never thought possible.
We selected Fox's 34 Rhythm fork and Float DPS shock for front and rear air springs that are easy to set up, easy to adjust and with a performance that'll have you coming back for more, ride after ride.
Combined with the hidden frame pivots, Agile Trail Geometry and refined kinematics, it's a setup that's tough to beat.
The Shimano 12-speed SLX and XT transmission shifts cleanly and precisely in any conditions, thanks partly to internally routed cables, whilst tough Fulcrum wheels shod with wide, grippy Schwalbe tyres are anchored by powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with a four-piston calliper up front.
We even remembered to fit a dropper post, so you can ride even the steepest of chutes in complete control.
The only thing that's missing is a rider.
Will you step up?
When your riding ambitions stretch further than your local trail centre, you'll want a bike that can rise to the challenge.
You'll love the sleek looks and light weight, because everything CUBE learnt about building great-handling, lightweight carbon bikes is ploughed into this svelte trail machine. the engineers started with premium C:62 carbon, then built a chassis with a short and stiff rear end for great handling and incredible efficiency, slender seat stays and narrow 27.2mm seat post for comfort and Agile Ride Geometry so you can get the best out of your skills on the trail.
But it isn't just great looking - its beauty is far more than skin deep.
Carefully selected components include the smooth-shifting, ultra-wide-ranging Shimano 1x12 gears - which put every climb within reach.
Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure you can keep your speed in check no matter what the weather or trail conditions, while grippy and fast-rolling Schwalbe tyres work in harmony with the RockShox Judy Silver air suspension fork to smooth the trail ahead.
And, naturally, it's available with the Size Split system blending wheel diameter and frame size, so that every rider can find her perfectly tailored fit.
Low weight, beautiful design and fantastic performance: you really can have it all with the Access WS C:62 Pro.
Everything CUBE learnt about building great-handling, lightweight carbon hardtails is ploughed into the Access WS C:62's frame.
Built with the C:62 carbon, it also features a short and stiff rear triangle - complete with Boost axle - for efficient pedalling.
The result is superb tracking and steering, sharp acceleration and, combined with the Agile Ride Geometry, inspiring handling all round.
A PressFit bottom bracket and integrated headset make the most of the weight savings CUBE finessed, while slim seat stays and a slender 27.2mm seat post help take some of the buzz out of the trail - good news if you like to ride not just hard, but long too.
We even included an easy upgrade option to a stealth dropper post, so you can keep riding when the trail gets super steep.
It's all in the details...
When you've put in the hours on your training, you'll want a bike that's capable of making the best of your efforts.
The Aerium C:68 SLT is that bike - utterly uncompromising in both design and execution to match your uncompromising approach to racing.
Developed in conjunction with the ærodynamics specialists at SwissSide, the engineering team began by ditching UCI regulations and setting a new goal: sheer, unadulterated speed, with no design limits.
Using a combination of sophisticated computer modelling, wind tunnel testing and real-world data-logging, the result is a bike that out-performs all its competitors in the tests.
It slices through the air thanks to its frontal area-reducing dropped seat stays and unique slotted head tube design.
It's even stable in cross-winds, something that not all æro bikes can claim.
This is a bike that's ready to race and to win.
Sophisticated C:68 Twin Mold construction allowed us to incorporate food storage and a drinking system, both of which are accessible from the æro riding position.
With completely enclosed cables and hydraulic brake hoses, every single detail is there for one purpose only - to help you ride faster.
A DT Swiss 1100 DICUT wheelset shod with tubeless Schwalbe tyres gets your power down to the ground via Sram's wireless Red AXS 2x12 transmission, and Magura's RT Aero Carbon rim brakes vie you the power you need to safely control speed when it matters most.
The only question is, are you?
With suspension kinematics tuned to be progressive for big hits but with more than a hint of the efficiency of the trail bikes, it's more agile than such a big-hitter has any right to be.
Built with the reassurance of having passed the rigorous in-house lab testing with flying colours, you can be certain that it's tough enough to accompany you on your adventures for many years to come.
Lightweight double-butted tubing saves weight where possible and maintains stiffness and strength where it's needed so that, combined with the Efficient Comfort Geometry, the Kathmandu EXC remains stable and predictable on any road, carrying any load. the exclusive Integrated Carrier 2.0 is the strongest, stiffest possible platform for carrying your essential gear, with sleek lines to complement the frame's great looks and an integrated rear light.
With the huge range of Shimano's legendary 3x10 transmission, you'll be able to make light work of any hill - and powerful hydraulic disc brakes will keep your speed in check on the way back down, too.
The Suntour air suspension fork is adjustable for any rider or load, and takes the edge off even the most potholed and rutted of routes.
Add the full-length mudguards, dynamo-powered light set and kickstand, and it's all you need for adventures both far and wide.
It's all designed with safe handling and the usual emphasis on durability in mind, so your kids can enjoy the ride and you can too, knowing that CUBE taken care of all the details.
The Suntour XCT JR fork is designed specifically with younger, lighter riders in mind and helps smooth out the trail ahead, while Shimano's easy-shifting 9-speed transmission has the range your junior rider needs to make light work of any climb.
We're not going to bore you with all the details, but let's just say that fitting the Bosch drive system and battery into a mountain bike frame suitable for kids isn't as straightforward as the engineers have made it look.
With looks borrowed straight from CUBE's mountain bike range and a design tailored specially for young riders, the Cubie 160 is the ideal introduction to the joys of pedal power. the engineers started with a geometry designed specifically around a child's needs, blending the fun of responsive handling with the safety of stable, predictable steering.
Sturdy and lightweight 6061 aluminium tubes build into a structure that's tough enough to stand up to enthusiastic use, but light enough to inspire - and of course, smooth edges and corners wherever possible help minimise the risk of injury.
Sensibly proportioned, child-friendly components are designed to last the course, so the rough and tumble of learning to ride won't result in broken dreams.
CUBE fitted a new alloy crank and a Hebie Chainlooper to keep the transmission safely enclosed, CUBE tyres with lots of grip, a comfortable ride and the rugged looks of a full-size mountain bike, and a motocross-inspired rear mudguard.
It's everything a future mountain bike rider could want.
The engineers started with a geometry designed specifically around a child's needs, blending the fun of responsive handling with the safety of stable, predictable steering - just like on the adult range.
With the SDURO FullNine 4.0 you can cruise the trails in a relaxed way.
The Yamaha PW-SE engine with double chainring offers you a finely tuned transmission range and thus optimal handling on the mountain and in the plain.
Quiet 29 wheels, the sensitive RockShox suspension elements as well as potent Shimano brake and shift components provide flow in easier terrain.
Designed around the elegant Easy Entry Town Hybrid frame, its clean lines hide a wealth of practical touches like enclosed cables, ideal weight distribution for safe handling and the Comfort Ride Geometry to put you in the best riding position for efficiency, safety and - you guessed it - comfort.
You know that niggling feeling that your bike might, just possibly, be holding you back a little?
You won't get that with the new Access Hybrid EX.
Combining a brand-new 29er e-bike frame with a 120mm fork, Boost rear end and powerful fourth-generation Bosch CX drive system, it leaves nothing on the table in pursuit of trail-riding e-bike nirvana. the engineering team pulled out all the stops to create a more versatile, better handling and easier to live with e-MTB specifically for women - and it's even available as a trapeze frame.
Starting with the new Modular Battery System, they created a gravity cast down tube that entirely encloses the powerful Bosch power unit behind a cover.
The result isn't just neat, it's also freed up enough space for the option of a more powerful 625Wh battery for extended range.
With internal cable routing - including for a future dropper post upgrade - and features aimed at reliable, intuitive handling, it's all the e-MTB you're ever likely to need.
Ride more, ride further, ride faster.
Never stand still for too long.
And the best news of all?
The Suntour XCM34 Boost suspension fork has the travel and steering precision to keep you comfortable and out of trouble, aided and abetted by big, grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with big 203mm rotors at the front - so you'll always be in full control.
Meanwhile, the Purion-controlled Bosch motor boosts your pedalling input via Sram's incredible SX Eagle 12-speed transmission, giving you the torque and gear range to easily tackle climbs that you previously considered unrideable.
Put it all together and it's clear that, if you're not feeling it out on the trail, it's not the bike that's the problem.
It's a pretty good approach to take in life, and it also happens to be one that you could apply to the frame designers.
The brand-new Access Hybrid 29 is the result of their never-ending quest for perfection - a fourth-generation Bosch-powered e-MTB that builds on all the experience to make a better handling, easier to live with bike.
With a design centred around the new Modular Battery System, its sleek looks are down to the fact that the Bosch power unit lives entirely inside the down tube under a protective, easily accessed cover.
The new design frees up enough space for a bottle cage mount and the option of a higher capacity battery, so you can extend your rides even further.
The smooth, powerful Bosch motor boosts your pedalling via an intentionally rigid frame design that encompasses a 12mm Boost rear axle, oversized chain stays and a 1.5in head tube - all features designed to ensure efficient power delivery, accurate steering and rock-steady handling.
CUBE designed it around the needs of a 120mm fork - so you've plenty of suspension travel to smooth out the trail ahead - and internal cable routing even includes provision for a stealth dropper post upgrade.
CUBE designed all this sophisticated frame wizardry in both standard and trapeze options, so that every woman can find the perfect Access Hybrid 29 for her own needs.
The heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame - with lightweight alloy fork - is crafted with the same attention to detail as the full-size bikes so that it's light, tough and handles beautifully.
A replaceable derailleur hanger means that accidents don't need to mean a written-off frame, and brake levers designed for smaller hands ensure that your child can learn to control their speed safely.
There's even a large 34-tooth bailout gear to provide some extra help for tired little legs on long or steep climbs.
The frame uses proprietary technologies like mechanically formed tubes and Compact Agile Ride Geometry to deliver the ideal blend of reassuring stability and inspirational control.
And the wide-ranging, smooth-shifting Shimano 2x10 gears put the right gear for any trail literally at your fingertips.
Combined with powerful hydraulic disc brakes and light, grippy Schwalbe tyres, it's the perfect setup to keep you in charge, no matter what the conditions.
Comfort, control and a whole heap of fun: who said a woman can't have it all?
And with that kind of performance, it'll come as no surprise that the designers went to town in kitting this bike out.
And, of course, none of the Allroad's added can-do attitude detracts from the Access's go-anywhere credentials.
There's a lot to be said for not messing with a succesful formula.
That's why, when we set out to design the standard-setting Agree Hybrid C:62 SLT road e-bike, we wanted to pay homage to road riding's long history of elegant, form-follows-function design.
When we set out to design the Editor, we had a very simple goal in mind: make the ultimate urban assault bike.

Special winter tyre for e-bikes.
Thanks to its non-slip tread pattern and special winter tyre compound, this premium tyre offers a lot of grip on slippery snow and wet-cold surfaces.
Vectran is a synthetically produced high-tech fibre with a natural model.
Vectran Breaker
Like spider silk, Vectran is a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP).
Handmade in Germany.
Developed by Continental's experts especially for e-bikes, the product is a reliable companion through the cold season.
Vectran is spun from the molten liquid polymer Vectra and processed into a multi-fibre yarn.
Spider silk as well as Vectran have an enormous tear strength at lowest weight.
The resistance is proven by many applications of Vectran: holding ropes for astronauts, spinnaker sails, submarine cables, cut-resistant clothing.
Vectran can be found wherever extreme durability is required.
The Vectran fibre has a tensile strength five times higher than steel, is fatigue-resistant and therefore extremely resilient.
Just the right properties to be used in a Continental top tyre as a puncture protection insert.
A Vectran Breaker is lighter, more flexible and protects more effectively against cuts than comparable nylon breakers without negatively affecting rolling resistance.
ECO
The tyres with the Continental ECO logo benefit from over 100 years of experience in the development of mopeds and motorcycle tyres.
Optimised and recommended for e-bikes up to 25 km/h, they guarantee low rolling resistance and good puncture protection thanks to their particularly high-quality construction.
The durability was especially tested on e-bikes to counteract premature wear caused by the additional driving force.
In addition, several models such as the Top CONTACT Winter II Premium have the ECE-R 75 test mark, which also permits use on fast e-bikes up to 50 km/h.
Dynamo Preparation
Tyres marked with the dynamo symbol have a special tread pattern in the side wall and are particularly suitable for the use of accompanying dynamos.
The dynamo runs more smoothly and does not slip through even in wet conditions.
The design of the dynamo knurling can vary depending on the tyre model.
The modern classic.
Not only visually the new Grand Prix in classic design upgrades every youngtimer and retro-racer.
The Supreme was the first Evolution line Marathon and now it's in its second generation.
The new OneStar compound makes it even faster.
With the new profile it not only looks good, but also rolls more nimbly than ever before.
Maximum comfort and speed are achieved in its Tubeless Easy version - unbeatable at the very fastest.
BlackChili Compound
The Gretchen question of cycling.
With the BlackChili Compound, a tread compound that is always based on the latest findings in polymer and raw materials research, Continental has provided the cycling scene with a lasting answer.
ProTection Apex
Enduro is the discipline that has been enjoying increasing popularity for some time now.
It is the technical challenge of fast, hard descents and strenuous climbs.
This requires a combination of puncture-proof construction, good rolling properties and excellent grip.
The proven ProTection layer reliably protects the tyre from cuts and punctures without unduly increasing the weight.
The additional apex sidewall stabilisation protects the tyre from punctures even at low tyre pressures.
To optimize weight, it is also possible to drive the tire tubeless ready together with Conti RevoSealant.
1000 ml of Shimano's tried and tested mineral oil for all Shimano disc brake systems
A non-slip BlackChili Compound tread provides the optimum pairing for efficient driving uphill and downhill without breakdowns.
tubeless ready
Tubeless Ready tires can be driven with or without inner tube, as the tire and rim are designed to seal directly against each other.
Compared to UST tires, however, tubeless ready tires are much lighter and therefore air-permeable in the sidewall.
This is sealed with special sealing milk.
All Continental mountain bike tyres are tubeless ready in the ProTection and performance versions.
The revolutionary Tubeless Ready foot allows an easy and uncomplicated mounting of the tyre.
For optimum sealing and application results, we recommend the use of the new Continental RevoSealant sealant .
When mounted correctly, the system is relatively airtight and less sensitive to snake bites than folding or wire tyres.
Especially voluminous mountain bike tyres benefit from this design.
Tubeless Ready tires can be driven with lower operating pressure.
The risk of breakdowns is considerably lower because there is no hose that can penetrate.
Even the wandering of the tyre on the rim has no consequences.
It also improves off-road grip, comfort and rolling resistance.

Fabric contains extremely fine fibres.
These make it possible to produce a lightweight fabric that feels soft, breathable and resistant to wind and rain.
An extra strong lock - our Red Cycling Products High Secure Chain Plus is the ultimate chain lock for those that need real peace of mind.

A patented dirt and rain guard prevents the cylinder from rusting if your bike is parked outdoors a lot.
The textile cover protects against paint damage and its decorative logo print makes it a real eye-catcher: telling every would-be thief that this bike is well locked.

Shimano HG (Hyperglide)
Ice Technology - Cooling Technology for Consistent Performance
Directional chains for road racing.
The latest chains from DURA-ACE, ULTEGRA, 105 and Tiagra feature a unique new asymmetric design.
The specially shaped plates optimise the engagement on the pinion and lead to even smoother shifting processes even under load.
To save weight, these chains have recesses on the inner plates and hollow rivet pins (the latter only with DURA-ACE).
The chain transfers force from the chain ring to the sprocket of the rear hub.
HG cassette sprockets
In combination with Shimano HYPERGLIDE (HG) chains the HG cassette sprockets provide fast, precise indexing function.
Shimano has introduced Ice-Tech brake discs and pads to provide optimum cooling technology for consistent performance.
The brake discs dissipate heat better thanks to the 3-layer sandwich structure with an aluminium core embedded in stainless steel.
This reduces the surface temperature by 100°C. In addition, the pads have cooling fins.
Less noise, less fading and less wear of the pads are the result of the lower temperature.
Available as plastic or metal compound.
Optional cooling fin pads and 2-layer support plate (aluminium cooling fins and stainless steel) improve heat dissipation.
Cooling technology increases the service life of the brake lining and reduces the risk of fading.
Ice-Tech rubber
Cooling fins
Plastic brake pads
Quieter than sintered metal linings, braking effect easier to dose.
The inner values are also impressive.
After all, the newcomer with brown flank and the original Conti Sport Profi l from 1982 is based on the current Grand Prix.
Thanks to PolyX-Breaker, high-strength and fine 180 tpi nylon carcass and the legendary BlackChili compound, it presents itself as a state-of-the-art racing tyre.
The contemporary dimension 25-622 of the folding tyre Handmade in Germany guarantees comfort and smooth running.

If there's one bike in the CUBE range that symbolises the freedom of two-wheeled exploration, it's this: the brand-new Kathmandu Hybrid Pro.
Whether you're an occasional commuter or regular cyclist, whether you ride to get around the city or to escape into the countryside at the weekends, this is a bike to feed your sense of adventure.
With a completely revised frame and new, fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit mated to Shimano's reliable 10-speed Deore transmission, the design team pulled out all the stops to create an adaptable, versatile ride companion.
From the Integrated Carrier 2.0 to the tapered head tube and fully enclosed, CUBE Modular Battery System, every detail of the Kathmandu Hybrid Pro's chassis is designed for strength, stiffness and durability - a fact that CUBE proved in the in-house test lab.
And, with a choice of Easy Entry, Trapeze or Men's frames, there's a Kathmandu Hybrid Pro to suit any rider.
But it's not just about function, because it wouldn't be a CUBE Hybrid if it didn't also have elegant lines and incredibly easy, intuitive handling thanks to its low centre of gravity.
With a tough Suntour suspension fork featuring 100mm of travel and a suspension seat post too, you're assured of a comfortable ride on even the roughest of road surfaces.
Grippy Schwalbe tyres and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure that you always have full control, no matter what the weather.
And practical touches like the full-length mudguards, integrated lighting system and CUBE kickstand mean you're fully equipped for wherever your busy life - or your curiosity - takes you.
CUBE thought of everything, so you can just enjoy the ride.
The Kathmandu Hybrid carries with it a deserved reputation for versatility, durability and comfort.
Completely redesigned around Bosch's superb new fourth-generation CX drive unit for 2020, CUBE built on this solid foundation with a new frame that's better looking, more practical and easier to live with than ever.
The heart of the new frame is the gravity cast down tube with new Modular Battery System.
Protected behind an easily accessed cover, the Bosch power unit fits tidily within the Kathmandu Hybrid's sleek frame, leaving plenty of space for bottle cage mounts and the option of a larger capacity battery for extended range.
The new Integrated Carrier 2.0 provides the most stable platform possible for carrying your gear, whilst complementing the frame's clean lines and boasting replaceable wear components - so you're assured of a long service life.
The tapered head tube assures accurate steering from the 100mm suspension fork, internal cable routing keeps gear shifts clean and precise with no need for regular maintenance, and we even included a neatly integrated kickstand mount.
As every keen traveller knows, the secret to success lies in the details.

In combination with the high-performance optics, this produces very uniform light distribution and ensures optimum illumination across all light zones.
The AURA 45 USB can be switched on by double-clicking on it, and then switched off again with a long keystroke.
This function prevents unintentional switching on, e.g. in the pocket.
The practical silicone handlebar holder is firmly attached to the AURA 45 USB and guarantees quick and precise attachment to any bicycle handlebar.
This allows the bicycle light to be mounted and removed without tools.
The AURA 45 USB is also compatible with other SIGMA mounting systems, such as the Screw Bracket and the Universal Helmet Mount.
Whatever you're looking for in an urban Bosch e-bike, you'll find it in the brand-new Kathmandu Hybrid EXC.
CUBE taken all the experience gained from designing some of the world's best e-mountain bikes and poured it into this versatile, sure-footed and adaptable tourer.
From the steering-enhancing tapered head tube to the strong, rigid Integrated Carrier 2.0, every detail is aimed at making the Kathmandu Hybrid EXC a reliable, versatile two-wheeled companion.
Built around Bosch's smaller, lighter, fourth-generation CX drive unit and a brand-new CUBE Modular Battery System, the frame's sleek appearance disguises the huge amount of time that's gone into designing and testing it.
Internal cable routing keeps the Shimano 11-speed transmission shifting smoothly with minimal maintenance, whilst the huge gear range and seamless power delivery from the Bosch drive system ensure that you can tackle any road with ease.
The battery can be recharged in situ, and there's a choice of powerful 500Wh or 625Wh units for extended range.
The mountain bike-inspired Suntour suspension fork has an easily adjustable air spring and 100mm of smooth, pothole-swallowing travel - and we even added a suspension seat post to keep you comfortably seated even on long days out.
Tough, grippy Schwalbe e-bike specific tyres work with powerful Shimano hydraulic discs to keep you in control whatever the weather, and of course full-length mudguards, a kickstand and integrated lighting system mean that 'fully equipped' isn't just a marketing slogan.

Short sleeve jersey with separate arm warmers for adapted protection like the professionals.
It is made from lightweight, waterproof, windproof and breathable ExoShell25ST fabric with a high stretch content and an athletic cut for a non-flutter racing fit.
Design Philosophy
When riding in extreme heat the body naturally diverts blood flow, and oxygen, away from working muscles to the skin in an effort to control core temperature.
This makes it harder for muscles to maintain a consistent work-rate and results in the onset of fatigue.
Enter the Pro SL Lite Jersey II; developed scientifically at the University of Kent’s Climate Chamber, this jersey is designed to keep riders cool so they can maintain their pace in the hottest climates.
Functional Detail
Utilises super light, rapid-wicking mesh front panels and a Translite rear panel with UPF25 sun protection.
The jersey is designed to move moisture away from the body to maximize cooling and keep the rider dry in the heat.
Three rear pockets offer ample space for small items.
Coldblack Technology
Features Coldblack technology, a fabric treatment that reduces heat buildup by reflecting infrared and ultraviolet UV rays off the fabric’s surface, thereby dramatically reducing the sunlight heating effect often experienced with dark materials.
Fit
Closefitting Lycra sleeves and lightweight silicone internal cuff grippers hold the jersey in place to reduce drag seen on looser-fit sleeves.
This one-piece suit is made of high quality Italian fabric and meets the highest performance requirements!
The pants feature Coldblack technology, a fabric treatment that reduces heat build-up by reflecting infrared and ultraviolet UV rays from the fabric surface, drastically reducing the heating effect of sunlight that often occurs with dark materials.

All-round protection
DD stands for Double Defense.
In addition to the RaceGuard protection belt there is an effective fabric protection on the side wall.
Normally the SnakeSkin fabric protection is used in mountain biking.
Double Defense
High Density Guard + SnakeSkin.
Dual Compound
There can be no greater safety for light off-road tyres.
Two different rubber compounds for better performance.
SnakeSkin
One of the most effective inventions Schwalbe has ever made for mountain biking.
The SnakeSkin fabric makes a tyre only 40-50 g heavier.
It is therefore well protected against contact with sharp-edged stones that quickly slit open the sidewall of light competition tires.
SnakeSkin - the best choice in rough terrain!
E-Bike-25 Ready

At CUBE they never stop exploring, questioning and seeking out new adventures.
CUBE always thought that the saying 'Jack of all trades, master of none' was rather unfair on Jack - and the Access Hybrid EX Allroad is a case in point.
By taking the versatile, well-equipped Access Hybrid EX e-MTB and equipping it with Bosch's CX Generation 4 drive unit, CUBE created a bike that can take on anything.
From weekend trails in the mountains to weekday commuting and everything in-between, it's got the kit that you need - and, with the option of both standard and trapeze frames, every woman can find her perfect fit.
We know that practicality is a key concern for some riders, so you'll be glad to know that the front and rear lights, mudguards and CUBE kickstand are standard features.
The powerful Bosch power unit is completely contained inside the down tube, protected by an easy-access cover - and the extra space that this arrangement has freed up means there's the option of an even larger capacity battery, for extra range.
Fast-rolling 29er wheels shod with big-volume, grippy Schwalbe tyres work with the Suntour XCM34 Boost fork's 120mm of travel to serve up all the comfort and control you need, whether you're tackling mean city streets or technical forest trails.

And, of course, you've the reassurance of knowing that the Access Hybrid EX Allroad has passed every in-house safety test we could throw at it.
So don't fret about Jack not being up to the job.
Because the Access Hybrid EX Allroad definitely is... whatever the job in question.
If that sounds like you, the new Access Hybrid EXC should be right up your street.
Completely revised for 2020 and built around the innovative new Modular Battery System and 29er wheels, it's a stunningly elegant manifestation of the need to get out as often as possible and ride - a Bosch e-MTB for the adventurous woman.
Clever features like an easy dropper post upgrade option, in-frame charging and a battery cover that's easy to access mean you're ready for anything.
The extra space freed up by the new battery housing even allows us to offer the option of a higher capacity Bosch power unit, for even more range.
Agile Ride Geometry combined with an X12 Boost rear axle, oversized chain stays and a 1.5in head tube makes for stunningly accurate, confidence-inspiring handling - and the 120mm Suntour XCR34 fork and extra-wide, grippy Schwalbe 2.6in tyres ensure you're always in full control.

And powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes mean you've always got the power at hand to stop reliably, whatever the weather throws at you.
But star of the show, of course, is Bosch's fourth-generation drive unit.
Smooth, powerful and incredibly easy to control, it's the invisible helping hand that'll extend your range, get you up climbs you never dreamed possible, and open up whole new frontiers of riding.
Dare to dream, live to ride, grab every opportunity.

In that case you'll be needing a Bosch e-bike that'll help you push your limits.

Hidden in the sleek down tube under an easily accessed cover, the powerful Bosch power unit is your ticket to extended days out on your favourite trails and long days exploring new routes.
Integrated cable routing complements the frame's Smooth Welding and sleek appearance, whilst reducing maintenance down-time and also allowing for an easy stealth dropper post upgrade for those sketchy line choices.
We tailored cockpit components like the stem, handlebar and saddle to the female anatomy, and there's even a trapeze frame option - so every woman can find her perfect fit.
Magura MT Fifty four-piston hydraulic disc brakes work with the Schwalbe 2.6in tyres to keep you firmly in control at all times, even when the smooth and easily adjustable RockShox Recon air fork's 120mm of travel helps you nudge the edge of your comfort zone on the descents.

The Access Hybrid SL is your best friend on your journey to new trails and new experiences...
The new Access Hybrid SLT encompasses everything CUBE learnt about building light, great handling 29er hardtails for women... and adds the power of Bosch's superb fourth-generation CX drive system, the range of an extra-large-capacity battery and the reliability of a stunning selection of premium components.
Starting with a blank sheet of paper, the engineers began by creating the innovative Modular Battery System, which houses the Bosch power unit securely inside the frame's down tube under an easily accessed cover.
They added a custom housing for the Bosch drive unit, then focussed on making the frame as efficient and agile as possible.
Oversized chain stays, a Boost 148 rear axle and 1.5in head tube help transfer every watt of your pedalling - and the Bosch motor's assistance - to the rear wheel via Shimano's superb SLX and XT 12-speed transmission.
Gear shifts are instantaneous and smooth - and they'll stay that way, thanks to internal cable routing that also allows for a quick and easy upgrade to a stealth dropper post, so you can seek out those borderline unrideable lines, if you like.
The 11-speed drivetrain, previously reserved for the top group XTR, is now also available for the much cheaper, but functionally hardly weaker, Deore XT.
Unlike their competitor SRAM, Shimano riders don't need a new freewheel body for their rear hub but can mount the Shimano 11-speed cassette on their regular 10-speed freewheels.
With the matching 11-speed gear lever and 11-speed chain, your bike can be upgraded to the current shift standard with manageable effort.
Moreover, your strides are well balanced as your socks stay in place.
On cross-country races, steep gravel ramps or long adventure rides in a wide variety of terrain you can prove your stamina with the Brava SLR.

It's time to treat yourself to the best.
You've sweated the climbs, owned the descents and racked up the miles.
Thanks to XXL wheels with a double-wall hollow section rim and reinforced spokes.
Big-volume, smooth-rolling Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres work with the smooth, easily configurable Fox 34 Rhythm fork to help keep the rubber side down - and we included Shimano's strong, powerful hydraulic disc brakes to ensure you're always in control, even on the fastest or steepest descents.
So go ahead - you've earned this.
There's no better Bosch e-bike hardtail for women, and no better way of expanding your trail-riding horizons.
They see what mum and dad are riding, and there'll come a time when they'll want something just as good.
Well, now they can.
The new Acid 240 Hybrid Youth SL features the same Bosch drive unit and battery as many of the adult bikes, so it'll give your young rider the power boost they need to ride further, faster and longer - good news for family rides.
Better yet, CUBE chosen some great components that give many of the full-size bikes a run for their money.
For example, the Shimano Deore 10-speed transmission features an enormous gear range and slick, reliable shifting.
Combined with the Bosch system's smooth, quiet power delivery, it gives your youngster all the oomph they need to tackle any climb - and keep up with mum and dad.
The Suntour XCR air fork is easily adjustable to suit smaller, lighter riders, and does a great job of ironing out the lumps in the trail.
And powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with a 180mm rotor at the front ensure there's plenty of stopping power for safely reining in any excess enthusiasm.
It's all your little ripper needs to extend their riding horizons as their confidence and abilities grow.
Shimano's powerful MT200 hydraulic disc brakes serve up plenty of stopping power in all weathers, and the Suntour suspension fork adds 100mm of bump and pothole-smoothing travel to the mix.
Sometimes you just want a bike that'll do it all, with no fuss.
That's what we had in mind when we built the Cross Hybrid Pro Allroad.
Completely redesigned from the ground up for 2020, this versatile Shimano Deore-equipped Bosch e-bike redefines what's possible in a hybrid all-rounder.
From the sleek, mountain bike-inspired frame to the grip of the wide 2.25in tyres and comfort of a 100mm suspension fork, every aspect of the Cross Hybrid Pro has been significantly improved.
Bosch's fourth-generation CX drive unit and Modular Battery System - in powerful 500Wh or 625Wh options, for even more range - delivers smooth, reliable power in a package that's smaller, lighter and neater than ever before. the engineers have worked overtime on the new frame, which is as practical as it is good-looking.
From the integrated cable routing for long-lasting smooth shifting to the tapered head tube for super-precise steering and neat mounting points for luggage rack and a CUBE kickstand, we like to think CUBE thought of everything.
The 10-speed Shimano transmission gives you the range you need to tackle any hill with confidence, whilst powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes bring you safely to a halt - and mudguards and lights are the practical extras that CUBE included so that you don't need to buy them.
Put it all together, and the Cross Hybrid Pro Allroad is the everyday two-wheeled companion that'll help expand your horizons.
Built around Bosch's smooth, powerful fourth-generation drive system, the new Cross Hybrid frame represents a completely new approach to the trekking hybrids.
Building on the experience gained from developing a new breed of mountain bike hybrids, the engineering team set about creating a frame that's sleeker, more practical and better to ride than ever.
Key to its success is the new Modular Battery System, which houses the Bosch power unit completely inside the gravity cast down tube.
Hidden from view behind an easily accessed cover, the new setup leaves room for bottle cage mounts - so you can stay hydrated on longer rides - and frees up enough space for the option of an even larger capacity battery for extended range.
A tapered head tube ensures accurate steering, integrated cable routing keeps gear shifts clean and accurate with minimal maintenance and geometry designed around a 100mm suspension fork means that the new generation of Cross Hybrids are more comfortable to ride - and more versatile - than ever.
We're proud of the Cross Hybrid.
We think you will be too.
Who says practical can't be fun?
When the engineering team set out to design the all-new Cross Hybrid Race Allroad, they had everyday versatility at the forefront of their minds.
But, as riders themselves, they also wanted to create a hybrid that's fun to ride.
So the Cross Hybrid Race Allroad blends all the frame-building know-how with Bosch's powerful new fourth-generation CX drive unit and a selection of smooth, reliable components - so you can concentrate on enjoying the journey.
The brand-new frame takes inspiration from the mountain bike hybrids, encompassing a new, modular and enclosed battery system and a motor mount that's so sleekly integrated into the frame's smooth lines, you'll find it hard to believe it's a hybrid.
The centre of gravity is low for safe, intuitive handling - and, like all CUBE frames, this one's passed the in-house torture testing with flying colours, so you know it's safe and durable.
Slick-shifting, reliable and wide-ranging Shimano XT 12-speed gears make climbing any hill a breeze, while the 500Wh or 625Wh battery gives you extended range - and there's no need to remove it from the frame for charging.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes, full-length mudguards and an integrated lighting system equip you for all weathers and any time of day, and neatly integrated rack mounting points make it easy to extend your Cross Hybrid Race's cargo-carrying abilities.
Meanwhile, grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres and a 100mm travel, air-sprung Suntour suspension fork give the confidence you need to tackle city streets or country roads in comfort.
Put it all together, and the Cross Hybrid Race is the consummate all-rounder for work, for play... and everything in between.
The all-new Cross Hybrid SL Allroad is the pinnacle of the versatile Cross Hybrid range. the designers wanted a Bosch e-bike that cut no corners in its pursuit of the ideal blend of comfort, safety and performance.
So, taking their inspiration from the CUBE mountain bike range and beginning with a blank sheet of paper, they applied the same principles - sleek lines, brilliant handling, no-compromise function - to come up with the bike you see here.
Completely reworked from front to rear, the frame's stunning looks disguise a masterclass in integrated design.
The fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit - smaller, lighter and more powerful than before - sits in a new housing complete with mesh cover, keeping the bike's centre of gravity low for safe handling.
A brand-new 625Wh modular battery sits inside a dedicated down tube housing, safe from the elements and easy to recharge even in situ.
There's even room for bottle cage mounts, so you can stay hydrated on longer rides.
The tapered head tube accommodates a smooth, easily adjustable RockShox Judy Gold fork with 100mm of travel and accurate steering on even the roughest of roads, while internal cable routing keeps the Shimano XT 12-speed transmission's shifts precise and smooth with minimal maintenance.
Included full-length mudguards incorporate a rear light to accompany the fitted front light, so you're never caught short at the end of the day.
The included CUBE kickstand and neatly integrated carrier mounts for a luggage rack upgrade add the finishing touches, and we even upgraded the powerful hydraulic disc brakes to a more powerful setup at both front and rear for assured stopping in any weather.
We're confident it'll fit into your busy, active lifestyle just perfectly.

Based around the new Modular Battery System, the elegant down tube has ample room for the Bosch PowerTube, hidden behind an easily accessed cover.
The new design isn't just exceptionally neat - it also meant the engineers could offer the option of a larger capacity battery for even more range, while still leaving room for bottle cage mounts.
The included CUBE kickstand frees you from finding a 'convenient' wall or tree on which to rest your bike, while full-length mudguards help keep you drier on wet roads and the lights allow you to see and be seen, regardless of how late in the day you end up riding.
The Suntour suspension fork, combined with wide Schwalbe tyres, smooths out even the bumpiest of roads.
And easy-to-use, reliable Shimano 9-speed gears work seamlessly with the Bosch drive system to boost your pedalling and make every ride and every hill that little bit easier.
We even fitted powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes for safe, assured stopping in any weather conditions. the goal was to sweat the details, so you can just jump on and ride wherever your spirit of adventure demands.
Because life's too short to be saying, 'one day, I'll get around to doing that ride'.
Do it now.
Do it with the Kathmandu Hybrid ONE.

With 4.0 inch tyres, a powerful Bosch CX drive system and smooth Manitou Mastodon Comp fork it's a bike that knows no limits, rolling on with nonchalent ease whether you're on a rocky mountainside or in the thick of the urban jungle.
Sand, snow, mud, gravel and rock are no barrier.
This CUBE masterpiece - with an aluminium frame designed specifically around the needs of the Bosch system and fat tyres - contains all the frame-building know-how.
From the 11 speed Shimano XT transmission to the powerful Magura MT5 hydraulic disc brakes and dropper post, there's everything you need here to open your mind, jettison the familiar and go explore.
We faced two challenges in designing the Nutrail Hybrid.
On the one hand, we set out to build a superb fatbike that would be fun to ride, wether that's on an everyday basis or on longer back-country adventures.
And on the other, we needed to perfectly integrate the Bosch drive, with all its specific requirements, into a frame designed around 4.0 inch tyres.
It wasn't easy, but we got there the usual CUBE way: by sweating the details.
Triple butted, hydroformed frame tubes and clever design contribute to a frame that's extremely light, with precision handling to match.
The tapered head tube and 177mm rear through axle provide even more rigidity.
We positioned the drive and battery for optimum performance and this, combined with the Agile Ride Geometry, guarantees faultless, intuitive handling.
Luggage rack mounting points add extra practicality for everyday use and, of course, we routed cables internally to keep your gears shifting smoothly.
Building a perfectly proportioned, balanced e-MTB that handles brilliantly and fits smaller riders really well isn't easy, but the engineers love a challenge.
The brand-new Reaction Hybrid Youth has all the features of the new adult Reaction Hybrid frames, in a 13.5in size that's ideal for the super-keen junior riders in your family.
Powered by Bosch's superb fourth-generation CX drive unit, its 400Wh battery lives neatly inside the down tube and can be charged in situ, if needed.
The 1.5in head tube, big cross-section down tube and oversized chain stays provide an efficient platform for the Bosch system to boost your young rider's power output, channelled through Shimano's smooth-shifting and incredibly reliable 10-speed Deore transmission to the 2.35in rear tyre.
We selected powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with a large 180mm front rotor, for dependable stopping power in all weathers.
And the Suntour XCM fork ensures that, however keen they get, there's plenty of help on tap to keep the rubber side down and the wheels rolling.
There's a kickstand mount for an easy upgrade, and it's even possible to fit a remote dropper post if you find you have an aspiring World Champ on your hands.
Because enthusiasm should be rewarded, but safety's important too.
The Reaction Hybrid Youth 400 has got it all covered, so you can get even more out of your family riding time...
Why shouldn't youthful enthusiasm be rewarded?
That was the starting point for the Reaction Hybrid Youth, which uses the same technologies and frame construction techniques as the adult Reaction Hybrid frames.
The oversized dimensions of the gravity cast down tube - along with the 1.5in head tube - help create a stiff backbone for a bike that, let's be honest, is going to be ridden with enthusiasm and quite likely a healthy disregard for risk.
This is also home for the Bosch battery, whilst the smooth and powerful drive unit sits in its own housing under a cover that's accessed by a single screw.
Internally routed cables keep gears shifting smoothly with minimal maintenance and, should your young ripper find themselves riding even more challenging lines, an upgrade to a stealth dropper post is quick and easy.
Feed their enthusiasm - and see the positive reaction.

Hidden by a double-layer cover with shock protection, push-button access and a hidden lock, the new system has freed up enough space for the Stereo Hybrid 160 HPC to accommodate a larger capacity 625Wh battery, for significantly extended range - so you can ride further, higher and faster, confident that you've got the juice to keep going.
The trunnion shock mount, big bearings and Boost 148 rear axle of the aluminium rear triangle work with the 1.5in head tube to deliver efficient power transfer and millimetre-perfect steering precision, whilst aggressive geometry gives you the advantage you need to show the trails exactly who's boss.
We even remembered to add a bottle cage mount and make it chain guide compatible, so you can tailor your Stereo Hybrid 160 HPC exactly the way you want it.
Enduro is exciting, but Bosch hybrid power takes it to a new level.
Welcome to the all-new Stereo Hybrid 160 HPC SL - a bike that redefines what's possible.
Building a world-beating enduro bike isn't easy.
Building one that combines genuine enduro performance with the ease of use of Bosch's amazing drive system is even harder.
Luckily, CUBE's years of experience at the Enduro World Series, as well as building class-leading Bosch e-bikes, helps make the job a tiny bit easier. the engineering team was able to draw on their extensive hybrid, carbon and full suspension design experience to create something remarkable: a 160mm travel bike with carbon main frame, progressive suspension kinematics and an aggressive geometry designed specifically for 170mm forks and tough enduro courses, plus seamless Bosch power.
The new CUBE Modular Battery System encloses the Bosch power unit in the down tube, hidden behind a shock-, moisture- and dust-proof cover that features a push button for access, as well as a hidden lock.
It's not just neat, it also enables us to increase the battery's capacity for even greater range out in the mountains.
Larger bearings, hidden cable routing, chain guide compatibility and space for a bottle cage mount are just some of the details that set this bike apart.
As for the spec, it would have been easy to cut a few corners... but that's not the CUBE way.
So you'll find a RockShox Deluxe Select+ shock and matching RockShox Lyrik Select fork up front, working together to deliver up to 170mm of boulder-swallowing travel.
A remote dropper post opens up new line choices, while Sram's NX Eagle 12-speed transmission ensures you can ride every bit of the link stages.
And Magura MT Fifty hydraulic disc brakes, combined with big-volume and super-grippy Schwalbe Hans Dampf tyres, give you all the power you need to control your speed on the timed stages.
Combined with Bosch's fourth-generation drive unit, it's all the excuse you need to head out into the mountains and smash out some new personal bests.
Because the Stereo Hybrid 160 HPC SL definitely is.
There's a lot to be said for keeping things simple.
That's why, when we developed the Town Hybrid EXC RT Bosch e-bike, we sweated the details.
So, for example, the beautifully integrated luggage carrier doesn't just look good, it also provides an unbelievably strong, stiff and stable platform for you to carry whatever you need with you, whether across town or on a longer excursion into the countryside.
Internal cable routing reduces clutter and ensures that the Shimano 8-speed hub gears keep shifting smoothly with absolutely minimal maintenance.
Careful positioning of the battery and powerful drive unit, combined with the Comfort Ride Geometry, creates a balanced ride feel that you'll instantly take to.
And, of course, the entire frame has been subjected to the in-house torture testing lab's attention, so you can be assured that it exceeds all current safety legislation.
Components like the RockShox Paragon Gold air suspension fork - which effortlessly smooths out the lumps and bumps of urban streets - have been chosen with reliability and ease of use in mind.
We fully enclosed the chain and fitted full-length mudguards, so you arrive at your destination looking as good as when you stepped out of your front door.
An integrated lighting system allows you to see and be seen, and the easy-to-use back pedal brake works in conjunction with the powerful, all-weather hydraulic rim brakes to ensure you're always in full control.
That's a whole lot of detail, but the result is an urban pedal-assist bike that's so simple to live with, you'll wish you'd discovered it earlier.

This is why PUKY play bikes are designed so safely and thoughtfully that everything works almost by itself and also provides lots of fun.
The low step through frame, which makes it easy to get on and off the bike, is not only important in the learning phase.
The child-friendly frame geometry guarantees a safe, comfortable and healthy seating position and the PUKY safety set, which is provided as standard, protects against possible injuries.
The robust powder coating, as well as high-quality components, guarantee a long service life.
Children not only expand their range of movement with the scooters, which run smoothly and safely, but also increasingly develop their sense for speed, steering and braking.
<p>The classic PUKY scooter is ideal to prepare children for a bicycle, because it trains the child's sense of balance similar to a learner bike, but also strengthens the leg muscles.
<p>PUKY learner bikes are an ideal complement to the classic scooter, and also the perfect preparatory stage for the first play bike.
They are characterised by their low step through frame and particularly child-friendly ergonomics.
The special learner bike saddles are ergonomically shaped and perfectly support the child's walking movements.
The handlebar and saddle are height-adjustable, allowing for individual customisation.
As a result, movement and the vehicle can be enjoyed for years.
<p>If only everything was as easy later on, as the introduction to child mobility with a well designed ride-on vehicle:<br /> <br /> All PUKY ride-on vehicles are designed so that small children who can already sit or walk can intuitively use them to move about, further developing their motor skills as a result.
Simple movements, such as strongly pushing off from the ground, are combined into complex processes - which is clearly very enjoyable.
Especially the enjoyment of movement - and that is very important.
It is only through movement that the basic senses of your child can develop and form a good foundation for successful learning.

The archetypal high quality touring tire!</p><p>Featuring the Endurance rubber compound that makes the Marathon more durable.
Furthermore it has a green "Plus":
Its GreenGuard protection belt (Schwalbe Puncture Protection Level 5) is made up by one third recycled material.
A three millimeter thick GreenGuard protection belt is placed under the tire tread, effectively protecting the tube from everyday cycling punctures.
</p><p>Schwalbe has equipped the Marathon with the innovative "Anti-Aging" side wall.
The tire will now tolerate this "low inflation overloading" for much longer before ugly cracks eventually start to appear.
In order to develop better resistance, Schwalbe technicians spent many hours performing harsh tests - poorly inflated tires, loaded with weights on a rolling-road, that artificially simulated unevenness over many thousand kilometers.
</p><p>In the bicycle market E-Bikes are currently a fast-growing segment, but these electrically power bicycles place special demands on tires.
Puncture resistance is clearly more important, because a tire change, or tube repair is far more difficult than is the case with an ordinary bike.
Also wear is much greater, because there is more power transmission and the bikes are also much heavier.
With its improved puncture protection and greater durability the new Marathon is much better prepared for E-bike use.

<p><b>Versatile, safe and durable</b></p><p>Continental's RIDE Tour offers everything a real all-round tyre needs.
A tread for every intended surface, the obligatory breakdown protection belt and a high mileage compound ensure the RIDE Tour is a trusted companion on your regular rides.
</p><p>The RIDE Tour was formerly known as the Tour Ride, and now features an upgraded 180 threads per inch casing rather than the previous 66tpi.
This means that the tyre casing is more supple, which means a quicker deformation around the road surface.
This gives both better rolling resistance (a faster ride for the given rider power input) and better puncture protection as the tyre is able to deform more quickly around sharp offending objects.
The perfect choice for the cycling city-dweller who goes to work, university or school every day.
</p><p><b>E-bike approved</b><br /> Optimised and recommended for e-bikes up to 25 km/h, they guarantee low rolling resistance and good puncture protection thanks to their particularly high-quality construction.
In addition, the e-bike tyres are extremely durable to counteract premature wear caused by the additional driving force.

Everywhere you look you find cool details like the stamped in Stereo logo on downtube and toptube gussets.

Surprisingly Small.
<p><b>Enormously Useful.
<br /></b>The GSD is designed to carry two kids, a week’s worth of groceries, or 180 kg of cargo, but it’s only 180 cm long—the same length as a standard ebike.
With Tern’s best-in-class folding technology, it packs down small enough to fit in a VW Touran or an urban apartment.
Plus, it adjusts to fit riders from 150 – 195 cm—so mom, dad and the kids can all share it.
</p><p><b>A Utility Bike Designed to Fit Your Life.
<br /></b>Despite everything it can haul, the GSD is actually the same length as a regular ebike, so it fits anywhere a standard ebike can.
But there are lots of places a standard ebike doesn’t fit.
That’s why we designed it to pack down to 1/3rd its volume in only 10 seconds.
That means you can store your utility bike in your urban apartment, fit it in the elevator, or stash it in a train for weekend getaways.
</p><p><b>Carries the Family<br /></b>With room for up to two Thule Yepp Maxi child seats, plus grocery space to spare, the GSD lets you ditch the minivan.
The low step-thru frame makes getting on and off much safer, and with an extra low center of gravity, the GSD is stable and steady.
</p><p><b>Fits the Whole Family Too<br /></b>Minivans don’t come in S, M, L &amp; XL to fit the driver, so why do bicycles?
The GSD is designed to be shared by a family.
It adjusts to fit mom, dad or the kids—any rider from 150 – 195 cm. Best of all, thanks to Tern’s adjustable stem, and compact geometry, adjusting the bike only takes seconds.
</p><p><b>Carry More</b><br />The GSD boasts cargo-bike capacity, despite its city-bike footprint—up to 180 kg (400 lbs.) including rider.
Build it up with Cargo Hold Panniers and the Shortbed and Transporteur racks, to carry industrial strength Eurocrates, a week of groceries or a family picnic plus the kitchen sink.

<p>Here's something a little different: a mid-travel Bosch e-bike with a focus on performance and trail-taming ability.
Cube’s Stereo Hybrid 120 HPC TM re-writes the full suspension rule book by combining a longer travel fork – 130 mm with the 29er version and 140 mm with 27.5 in wheels - with the proven comfort and traction advantages of Cube’s well-regarded Stereo 120 platform.
Why?
So that you've the confidence to ride that little bit faster, that little bit further and that little bit tougher... but all in comfort and complete control.
The Fox 34 Float fork and Float DPS EVOL shock work together to swallow tough bits of trail and spit them out in more manageable chunks, helped by the grip and cushioning of Schwalbe's 2.6 in Hans Dampf tyres.
Shimano's superb 11 speed XT transmission works in complete harmony with the powerful, smooth Bosch CX drive including the multifunctional Kiox display to deliver a mountain-taming range of gears, and Newmen finishing kit provides a comfortable place to park yourself.
All you need now is an appetite for adventure, and some trails to explore.
Let's ride...
</p><p>There's no doubt that designing a trail-ready carbon full suspension e-bike is a major challenge... but that's just the kind of thing that gets Cube’s engineering team out of bed in the mornings.
Their starting point was the sleek down tube that fully encases the battery and, with a bash plate, the motor too.
Protected from dust, water and rocks, this setup doesn't just look good, it also lowers the bike's centre of gravity for greater comfort and livelier handling in all trail conditions.
Speaking of which, a higher bottom bracket increases ground clearance on tough trails, while the longer head tube creates a more comfortable ride position for long days in the saddle.
Internal cable routing keeps gears shifting cleanly for longer with minimal maintenance, and the Boost rear end helps improve steering precision and power transfer.
As you'd expect, Cube’s Agile Ride Geometry gives the Stereo Hybrid HPC TM handling to match its looks, with precisely the right blend of agility, stability and comfort to keep you coming back for more.
<p>The Stereo Hybrid 160 Action Team has earned the right to wear this coveted name because Cube is confident it can meet the stringent demands of enduro riding under the toughest of conditions.
</p><p>Not much gets Cube's design team as excited as the opportunity to build a no-holds-barred, all-out team edition bike.
<p>If you like your riding served up in big portions of adventurous terrain with views to match, you'll want a bike that's up to the job.

</p><p><b>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</b><br />Our engineers went through dozens of frame iterations and conducted hundreds of hours of CFD and wind-tunnel analysis to skillfully balance the fit, handling, stiffness and aero performance of the R3 with frames that weigh less than the previous ultra-lightweight model.
Underlying all of this are new Squoval Max tube shapes, which have been redesigned to fortify cross-sections and push the R3 to new heights.
</p><p><b>WEIGHT</b><br />As a world-class climbing weapon, lightweight design is a top priority for the R Series.

Then there’s the R3’s new handling geometry and wider tire clearance, which improve stability and performance-boosting comfort.

</p><p>In order to fulfil its mission, POC always develops its helmets with regard to the entire helmet, i.e. the interaction of all materials and features.
SPIN (Shearing Pad INside) is POC's patent-pending silicone pad technology, which uses innovative materials that enhance the protective effect in combination with the core and shell.
Thanks to its simple size adjustment system in circumference and height, the Omne is comfortable to wear and fits perfectly.
</p><p><b>SPIN technology</b><br />Oblique impact protection is necessary to counter the forces involved in non-linear impacts, which are a common cause of head injury.
SPIN (Shearing Pad INside) pads are integrated inside a helmet and add an extra layer of oblique impact protection by shearing in any direction, reducing the force transmitted to the brain.
The most common type of fall results in an angled, or oblique, impact with the ground or object which can lead to a rotation of the helmet and head.
</p><p>Research has shown that compared to a direct, or linear, fall the force required to cause serious head injury from an oblique impact is often much lower.
To counter this common impact scenario, POC created SPIN pads which are an evolution on nature’s own design and use an innovative pad technology and design.
SPIN pads are optimized to provide oblique impact protection based on the precise location inside the helmet and by using various pad technologies which can shear in any direction.
The aim is to minimize the effects of an oblique fall by allowing the helmet to move relative to the head.

Cross country riders have always been keen to ride the lightest bike possible.
Studies have shown, however, that they should focus more on their helmets: a high head temperature causes the body to produce more sweat.
This leads to a great loss of fluid, or in the worst case to dehydration - naturally having an extremely negative effect on performance.

<p>The ELEMNT Bolt by Wahoo Fitness is the first computer designed as an integrated system with aerodynamics as the central feature.
A performance-oriented form, combined with the powerful technology of the ELEMNT from the company that has broken the cycling computer stereotypes.
Working with world-renowned aerodynamic expert Dimitris Katsanis, Wahoo developed the most aerodynamic cycling computer while improving the user experience.
</p><p><b>Integrated mounting system<br /></b>Developed as a system:
The ELEMNT Bolt and the integrated handlebar mount become a highly aerodynamic unit, made for the front of your bike.
</p><p><b>Why is this more efficient?</b><br />The conical shape of the computer connected to the bracket creates a large, even surface that produces less air resistance.
</p><p>The BOLT system has been proven to reduce air resistance by &gt; 50% compared to its leading competitor.
This device was developed for maximum readability and minimal air resistance.
If one tilts the leading competitor to better read the display, the air resistance increases significantly (thus slowing down the rider).
In contrast, the resistance remains the same for the ELEMNT BOLT and doesn’t adversely affect performance.
</p><p><b>What does this mean for your result?</b><br />In a 40KM time trial with an average speed of 35 km/h you save 12.6 seconds compared to the competitors.
</p><p><b>Easy to configure</b><br />Wahoo has reinvented the setup process on bike computers, of course, the BOLT has this technology.
</p><p><b>Download, connect &amp; configure</b><br />Download the Companion app to connect to the BOLT and use the intuitive interface of your smartphone to personalise and configure your bike computer.
</p><p><b>Quicklook LED indicators</b><br />Programmable LEDs provide you with notification of right / left turns, calls and text messages, pulse or power ranges, Strava Live segments and Best Bike Split destinations.
</p><p><b>Perfect overview</b><br />Zoom in and out of the preset data fields with just one touch of a button.

</p><p><b>ACTIVE FOOT FRAME</b><br />[the bucket seat] <br />The Active Foot Frame beds the heel and foot deeply into the midsole, offering guidance to the foot without the need for “posts” or other foot constrictions.
<p>After you've given your all in the race, your feet deserve a break.
That's exactly what Hoka One One's new Recovery Flip is for.
Of course, this flip-flop is also equipped with the popular Oversize midsole and the Meta-Rocker from HOKA.
Your tired feet will thank you for it!</p><p><b>META ROCKER</b><br />The Meta-Rocker low-explosion midsole construction with rounded outsole provides a unique and smooth running feel.

This versatile All Terrain performer features a wider flare in the forefoot and toe, which allied with the shoe's cushion and durability, means you can go farther and longer.
And with more lugs, more tightly packed, you can be surefooted whatever the conditions.

It's aggressive-looking and aggressive doing, taking you far and wide in comfort.
The game-changing Bondi is the most cushioned shoe in HOKA ONE ONE’s road-shoe lineup.
The Bondi 6 offers a smooth, balanced ride delivered by the full- EVA midsole, the comfortable and breathable upper, and our Meta-Rocker technology.
Made for those who run but don’t just run, CAVU offers a versatile running shoe with a bold and simple look.
A little lower, and a little lighter than its category mates, Cavu features HOKA ONE ONE’s much lauded ‘intelligent’ PROFLY cushioning—softer in the heel for shock absorption, and firmer in the forefoot for propulsion and energy return.
That responsiveness is further enhanced by the outsole’s zonal RMAT.
HOKA ONE ONE employs rubberised foam to increase response, grip and durability to the midsole, while a patented MATRYX fabric upper delivers exceptional foothold, protection, and water drainage.
Stripped down to its performance core, like a dune buggy, EVO JAWZ offers a thrilling and unbridled ride.
It is low to the ground with a firm (not rigid), midsole that relishes muddy and uncertain terrain.

How far off-road you go is up to you.
An all-new premium stability shoe, the GAVIOTA features superior cushioning along with new HOKA ONE ONE J-Frame technology.

Designed and built with the collaboration of world class HOKA ONE ONE trail athletes, the Torrent boasts competitive credentials.
Created as a trail racer, it incorporates the seemingly contradictory combination of cushioning and agility.
The lightweight performance is made possible with a PROFLY midsole, providing a forgiving landing and responsive toe-off.
High-traction rubber and aggressive lugs mean that when your feet are on the ground they’re sure of their footing.
Marry that with a breathable upper and you’ve got a super lightweight, nimble, and technical trail racer that allows you to tackle a variety of terrain at any speed.
With every iteration, the Arahi rewrites the history of the support shoe.
Boasting the seemingly contradictory attributes of maximum cushion with minimum weight, the Arahi 3 delivers a more refined midsole and improved heel rocker.
When we launched the J-Frame midsole in 2017 we believed that it heralded the future of the stability running shoe.
Simply put, stability had gotten complicated, so we simplified it with Dynamic Stability, which supports the foot by guiding it through its natural gait cycle without the use of rigid and unforgiving materials.
It meant all runners could enjoy HOKA ONE ONE’s cushioned, lightweight ride without constrictions.
The Arahi 3 brings all the innovative features from the Arahi 2 and adds an all-new lightweight upper.
Engineered from breathable mesh with increased midfoot lockdown, the upper and improved midsole makes the Arahi 3 the most nimble and most supportive ride yet.
With the launch of the first Gaviota, the runner looking for a stability shoe could at last shake off the constrictions of traditional support shoes.
A premium stability shoe, the Gaviota 2 features superior cushioning along with the HOKA ONE ONE J-Frame design.
The Gaviota 2 embraces the J-Frame further offering consistency in fit and ride.
Plus a new upper.
Made from engineered mesh, the upper offers superior breathability to its predecessor while embracing all that made it breakthrough.
The Arkali heralds a new breed of hiking shoe.
There’s off-road, off-trail and then there’s off the map.
HOKA ONE ONE has just gone vertical with the Arkali.
A combination of running shoe innovation (light and comfortable), climbing shoe technology (exceptional grip and traction) and hiking boot engineering (rugged and protective), the Arkali looks ready for anything.
And with a MATRYX upper, high-abrasion toe cap and adjustable heel and ankle straps, it is.
It features a PROFLY midsole, which has a softer heel and more responsive toe off, plus 5mm multidirectional Vibram Megagrip rubber lugs.
The Arkali is waiting to take you to the top of the world.
Speed hiker used to be an oxymoron, but that perfectly describes the Toa.
Leveraging HOKA ONE ONE trail running expertise and innovations, we built a “lightest in class” waterproof hiker for adventures across any terrain.
Everything about the Toa has been evaluated from a functional and weight-saving perspective.
From the durable and breathable synthetic upper, to the rubberised foam midsole and the Vibram Megagrip outsole lugs, all elements are technically solid and efficiently lightweight.
And the cushioned running shoe feel is further enhanced by an eVent waterproof bootie to keep your feet dry and comfortable.
The sky’s the limit, speed hiker.
With surprising speed, it makes the ups easier and the downs quicker.
When hiking over long distances, this trekking shoe will deliver you to your destination in comfort and safety.
Unequaled in its weight-to-cushion ratio, the Kaha offers the full HOKA ONE ONE package – proprietary foams, patented geometries and exceptional Vibram Megagrip traction.
Soft and smooth, but inherently supportive, the Kaha features an eVent waterproof bootie that’ll keep your feet comfortable and dry regardless of the conditions.
And an adjustable lacing system provides a lockdown fit regardless of your foot type.
The world is your oyster.
The Cavu 2 is a versatile running shoe with a bold and simple look.

A complete bike stuffed with fine stereo equipment.
And only for 2019 rollin on Stereo´s very own humbucker tires.
</p><p>The Woofer is the thing for an entry level rider.
All of Stereo´s team ideas went into this bmx bike.
For Stereo it was clear that they need a bike for a starter with a unique geometry, easy to handle for all tricks.
</p><p>For this year Stereo calls the woofer one of a kind.
Ask Stereo´s pro riders, they love it.
They added some pro smell stuff like the aftermarket stereo humbucker tire which is made for street, park or other terrain.
<p>We were the first one who came out with a 19 inch top tube rollin on 20" wheels.

The top tube of the subwoofer measures a short 19 inch combined with a smaller handlebar and short cranks.
</p><p>For kids with a real passion for bicycle motocross the subwoofer has eyerything to offer.
From fully sealed bearing stereo hubs to stereo denim slim seat combo this bike leaves no dreams open.
<p>Stereo´s 18 inch kids modell rules the scene, cause they only shrunk a regular bmx to kids size.
Ask the dudes who ride it.

</p><p><b>4X4 DYNAMIC STRUCTURE</b><br />The external forces acting on the frame under the rider's weight, such as cornering or ground vibration, impair control and traction.
The natural bending pattern in the top tube due to an additional fourth bend allows an efficient, smooth ride, as if the wheel floats above the rough ground.
</p><p><b>29"</b><br />Instead of trying to force every rider into a single wheel size, Orbea offers "Big Wheels" for riders of all sizes.
The Alma offers you five frame sizes and two wheel sizes:
Small and medium with 27.5" wheels and small, medium, large and XL with 29" wheels.
</p><p><b>BOOST</b><br />With its 420 / 430 mm chainstays and the increased strength of its continuous 12 mm axle system, the Alma is more precise and responsive than ever.
The Boost 148 standard stands for a wider rear end, allowing the chain to move outwards by 3 mm and thus more space at the crank.
</p><p><b>WORLD CUP GEOMETRY</b><br />The refinements of the Alma World Cup geometry reflect the development of the elite race.
The more relaxed steering head angle (69.3º / 69.5º) offers more stability on increasingly demanding slopes.
The steeper seat angle and lower handlebar height increase steering precision and pedalling efficiency.
The shorter chainstays (420/430 mm) offer maximum agility without loss of stability.
<br /><br /></p><p><b>MONOCOQUE</b><br />Orbea uses the most advanced technology for carbon production to produce the most demanding frames.
You will appreciate the results of this complicated, careful process on the road.
<p>You knew when you planned the ride it would be a long day - a route stacked with grinding climbs and twisting descents, terrible roads with a good amount of who-knows-what-else thrown in. These rides aren’t most people’s idea of fun, but they sure are memorable, monumental, challenging.
You suck down another coffee and pull on your shoe covers to hold the weather at bay, it’s going to clear out and warm up in a few hours...
Probably.
Grab your Avant and do a quick check before rolling into the morning mist.
No other machine could better help you endure the hours of rough, exhausting conditions ahead.
It’s going to be a long day - and you love it.

<p>In Nordic Mithology, Laufey is the mysterious mother of Loki, the most sneaky swindler of all time.
</p><p><b>trail geometry</b><br />The Laufey is more aggressive thanks to its 130mm fork and durable tyres.
</p><p><b>HYDROFORMING</b><br />Orbea manipulate the shapes and thicknesses of aluminium tubes to achieve greater strength and resistance while avoiding undesirable deformation.
</p><p><b>BOOST</b><br />The 430 mm short chainstays make the Laufey fast, resistant and responsive.
</p><p><b>DIGIT</b><br />This is not a dropper support, but a quick adjustment support.
</p><p><b>DOUBLE DUTY 27+ / 29</b><br />Double Duty means two wheels in a single model.
<p>Natural progression leads us to more aggressive trails.
Riders want an Occam AM with more travel, larger tires, extra stability and more opportunity for MyO Lite customization.
The 2018 Occam AM checks all the boxes - Occam AM steps up to 150mm travel with a slacker 66.5º head angle and wider rims, making even the toughest terrain faster and more fun.
The new Fox Float DPX2 gives more sophisticated damping that you'll need when the trail gets bigger.
<p>It's a natural development that we are looking for ever more demanding routes.
That's why Occam TR riders are demanding more travel, bigger tyres for extra stability.
The Occam TR 2018 meets all these requirements.
Thanks to the 130 mm suspension fork, thicker tyres and wider tyres, the Occam TR becomes significantly more aggressive.
Because the innovations go beyond any frame, Orbea developers have redesigned the rear end to extend the Occam range with the 27.5" Plus platform.
Whether with 29" x 2.4" or 27.5" x 3.0" tyres, the Orbea Occam TR is ready for any terrain, even if it gets a bit coarser.
<br /><br /><b>DOUBLE DUTY 27.5"+ / 29</b><br /> DOUBLE POWER/27+ DOUBLE POWER means two bikes in a single model.
This means that the Plus tyres go further than their rivals, even in mud, snow and sand, on virtually any terrain.
<br /><br /><b>PROGRESSED DYNAMICS</b><br />Advanced dynamics is not a form of design, but a development process.
This unique method developed by Orbea transforms virtual models into truly sophisticated racing machines:
Bikes for demanding riders who are faster, more fun and leave all normality far behind.
<br /><br /><b>TRAIL GEOMETRY</b><br />The Occam TR offers a rear suspension travel of 120 mm, which is extended to 130 mm by the fork and fast 29` tyres.
<br /><br /><b>MONOCOQUE</b><br />Orbea use the most advanced technology for carbon production to produce the most demanding frames.
You'll appreciate the results of this complicated, careful process on the road.
<br /><br /><b>UFO</b><br />Orbea have managed to eliminate the pivot point of the rear axle.
The flexible design of the seat stays allows for an ultra-light bike with low maintenance requirements, yet offers exceptional stiffness and acceleration for full-suspension bikes.
UFO results in a weight saving of more than 140 g and also makes the Occam even faster.
<br /><br /><b>BOOST</b><br />With its 435 mm chainstays and the increased strength of its continuous 12 mm axle system, the Occam TR is extremely precise and responsive.
The Boost 148 standard stands for an increased rear axle length of 148 mm, which allows the chain to move 3 mm outwards and thus offers more space at the pedal crank.

<p>Cube designed the Nature to be the perfect introduction to the joys of freedom on two wheels.
Whether you need a bike for getting around town or exploring further afield at the weekend, this is the tool for the job.
With a high quality aluminium frame featuring details you wouldn't normally see at this price, it's a comfortable, easy to use and low maintenance riding companion.
With the comfort of a suspension fork, a smooth-shifting Shimano 24 speed transmission and the all-weather stopping power of hydraulic disc brakes, you can rely on your Nature to get you there in style and complete safety.
<br /><br />There's a good reason that the Nature is lighter than similar models on the market.
Double butting removes material - and therefore weight - where it's not needed, while leaving it alone where it's important for strength.
It's all down to the lightweight, double butted tubes that make up the aluminium frame.
New for 2019, Cube has updated the frame with sleeker luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points, so you can easily upgrade your bike for any purpose.
Complex profile top and down tubes contribute to a frame that's rigid enough for precise, safe steering, but still comfortable on any ride.
And, as with all Cube bikes, the Nature has passed every EU and in-house safety test, meaning that you can enjoy your riding with complete peace of mind.
<p>Cube had a simple goal in mind when they set out to design the Editor: make the ultimate urban assault bike.
Ultimate looks, ultimate comfort, ultimate speed, ultimate practicality.
That's why they gave it an advanced aluminium double butted frame, then fitted a sleek rigid fork.
It's the reason they didn't compromise on the transmission, selecting Shimano's superb Alfine 11 speed hub gear and combining it with a Gates belt drive for silent running and practically low-maintenance performance.
And it's also why Cube’s engineers refined the mudguard and luggage carrier mounting points, so that your bike retains its good looks at all times.
It's the thinking behind the powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, which offer reliable stopping in even the wettest of conditions.
Because what use is performance, if you can't have it with a big dollop of style on the side?<br /> <br /> Why is this frame so comparatively light amongst urban bikes?
Well, only the engineers know the precise reason for that (and they're not telling).
But Cube knows enough to be able to tell you that it has a lot to do with the double butted aluminium tubing, which saves weight where it's not needed without compromising strength or stiffness.
Cube can do that with certainty because, like all their bikes, the Editor has passed stringent testing in their own laboratory to ensure it'll withstand hard use.
It's also been specially designed to cope with the specific demands of the Gates belt drive, with an eccentric bottom bracket housing to make adjusting belt tension a simple process.
They even found room for two bottle mounts, so your weekday urban sidekick can double up as a weekend companion in the country.
<p>Cube thinks that the whole point of a bike is to inspire adventure.
<br /><br />You'll find technologies in the Cross Pro frame that ordinarily belong in much more expensive bikes.
<p>Cube wanted to make something a bit special with their Reaction TM.
</p><p>A bike built to take on the trails at speed needs to fulfill three criteria: it must be stiff, it must be light, and it must be comfortable enough to ride all day.
Because wouldn't you rather be riding...?</p><p> </p>
<p>Cube built the Reaction Race with one thing in mind: speed.
<br /><br />The Reaction Race represents the state of the art in aluminium hardtail frame construction - light, strong, efficient.
<p>Cube Teamline colours don't end up on just any old bike.
<br /><br />The remarkable achievement of the Elite C:68 SL is that it combines exceptional stiffness - for efficient pedalling and accurate steering - with fantastically low weight and surprising comfort.
<p>Designed as a trekking bike, only a few details show that the TC-E is an e-bike.

The Sting 140 HPC SL 27.5 is an uncompromisingly light, stiff, fast and agile suspension bike built with one goal in mind: to be the best of its kind.
Featuring a carbon frame with geometry optimised for a 150 mm fork, Cube's designers went to town kitting this bike out.
From the Fox Float Factory 34 fork and Fox Factory DPX2 shock to the Newmen wheelset and Sram X01 12 speed transmission with Guide RSC hydraulic disc brakes, Cube has selected only the best of the best so that you can ride at your best, too.
There's even a Fox Transfer Factory dropper post to help with tackling those especially tricky technical lines.
And, with frame sizes starting at 13.5 inch, there's a Sting 140 HPC SL 27.5 to suit every woman.
Like all the best things in life, it won't let you down.
<br /><br />There's some clever stuff going on in the Sting 140 HPC SL 27.5's carbon and aluminium frame.
Short chainstays, a steep seat angle, lots of reach and a head angle designed specifically for 150 mm forks are just some of the ingredients that go into making a frame that climbs just as well as it descends, as well as steering precisely and intuitively.
Cube fitted a Boost 148 axle at the rear to complement the tapered steerer's enhanced steering accuracy, and they even managed to hide the suspension's pivot points away and tuck the cables inside the carbon main-frame for a clean, svelte appearance that you'll love.
Light, stiff and as agile as a mountain goat, it's a frame built to help you push your limits.
The fact that it looks so good is just a bonus.
<p>Fat-tyre adventures begin with a bike that you can rely on - a companion that'll be with you over every pebble, rock and root, no matter where you explore.
<br /><br />Safe, predictable handling is the backbone of any bike.
<p>Feel the need for speed, at least some of the time?
The Axial should be right up your street.
The high quality, lightweight aluminium frame is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind, complemented by a carbon bladed fork to help filter out road vibration.
Cube selected Shimano's Claris groupset for its wide gear range and easy shifting - and it now features a lighter PressFit bottom bracket and Hollowtech II cranks.
With Continental Ultra Sport 2 tyres on a Cube wheelset with DT Swiss spokes and a saddle, stem and handlebar specially selected for female riders, you're fully equipped for any ride, wherever it takes you.
A wide range of sizes means every woman can find the right fit, too - a versatile sports tourer with your name on it.
<br /><br />The Axial achieves that delicate balancing act of being both light and stiff, thanks to the use of double butted 6061 aluminium Superlite tubes.
Strength and rigidity are important for safety and confidence-inspiring handling, so Cube included design details like an oversized, cross-ovalised down tube, tapered head tube and 3D forged dropouts.
Each of them adds to the Axial's accurate steering and efficient power transfer, which means that you can just get on with enjoying the ride.
The carbon fork and cross-ovalised Flex Stays - combined with a slender 27,2 mm seatpost - are designed to add extra comfort, while Cube has refined the geometry to ensure a compact but efficient ride position that's particularly suited to longer distances.
Internal cable routing complements the frame's svelte looks and reduces the need for fiddly maintenance - a double win.
Because you'd rather be out riding...
<p>For the Reaction C:62 Pro Cube began with their light, responsive and agile carbon frameset.

From the slick-shifting new Shimano 105 2x11 drivetrain to the powerful, all-weather Shimano 105 disc brakes - with STI levers designed for smaller hands - and the beautifully crafted aluminium frame and carbon fork, every detail has been finessed with speed and comfort in mind.
It's the complete performance-orientated package, put together by Cube's expert team so that you can concentrate on the ride.
<br /> <br /> Speed demands stiffness, but comfort requires a subtler approach - and greater comfort can often equal more speed, too.
The Axial Race Disc blends both in one beautifully integrated package, making it a formidable mile-munching companion for the long haul.
The double butted Superlite aluminium chassis includes features like an oversized, cross-ovalised down tube, tapered head tube and PressFit bottom bracket - all designed to contribute to its impressive rigidity, accurate steering and efficient power delivery.

The Access WS Pro Allroad is a true crossover bike that combines the best of go-anywhere ruggedness with a dose of urban practicality.
The included mudguards and luggage carrier attach almost seamlessly to the frame via newly redesigned mounting points, while the kickstand and built-in lighting system ensure that you'll always be at home on the city streets.
But it's not just about being practical, because underneath the no-nonsense design is an accomplished off-roader with everything you need to have fun.
Light and grippy Schwalbe tyres combine with the Suntour fork - with remote lockout - and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes to give you all the comfort and control you need, whether you're tackling potholed streets or a bumpy forest track.
Smooth-shifting and wide-ranging 27 speed Shimano gears will help you tackle even the steepest of climbs, and everything from saddle to stem, grips and handlebar has been selected to fit the female form for day-long comfort.
Add it all up, and the Access WS Pro Allroad looks very much like all the bike you're ever likely to need.
<br /><br />What good is comfort and control if you can't have fun too?
That's why Cube's engineers designed the Access WS Pro's frame around the Compact Agile Ride Geometry - to give it the best blend of poise, comfort and agility backed with Cube's comprehensive in-house testing for complete peace of mind.
Featuring a redesigned top and down tube for 2019, Cube has maximised standover clearance for the ultimate in on-trail confidence and ensured safe, accurate steering and efficient pedalling.
It's all down to complex, mechanically formed 6061 aluminium tubes... and a lot of design expertise.
Revised rack and mudguard mounting points match the frame's sleek looks, while internal cable routing keeps gear shifting clean and accurate without the need for regular maintenance.
And the Size Split system means every rider can find her perfect fit, from the 13.5 inch frame with 27.5 inch wheels to the 19 inch 29er.
There's only one thing that's missing from this versatile, do-anything bike: you.
The carbon fork blades and slender seat stays, meanwhile, are there to improve comfort by filtering out some of the vibration from harsh road surfaces, so that you can ride in comfort for longer.
And, to top it all off, Cube ran the cables internally for cleaner looks and greatly reduced maintenance.
<p>Give CUBE's product designers the freedom to use only the very best materials and components, and this is the kind of thing they come up with.
<br /><br />The latest carbon technology incorporated in our Advanced Twin Mold monocoque production process - combined with our high end C:68 carbon - means that this state of the art frame is as light and stiff as possible, while also managing to remain surprisingly comfortable.
<p>Heading to the ends of the earth, or just to the edge of the map?
<br /><br />You can't broaden the mind if you're not comfortable.
<p>If there's an aspiring young mountain biker in your family, chances are they're already pushing their boundaries.
The Reaction 240 TM will be right there with them, building their skills and confidence as they get faster and bolder out on the trails.
Shimano's 1x11 SLX transmission provides a simple, reliable and wide-ranging choice of gears via its 11-46 tooth cassette, making the right gear selection for any trail scenario just a click or two away.
Powerful hydraulic disc brakes add easily controllable, all-weather stopping.
Cube selected a Suntour air sprung fork with 70 mm of travel, rebound adjustment and a lighter negative spring specifically aimed at younger and lighter riders.
Finally, Cube fitted Schwalbe Smart Sam 2.35in tyres for their confidence-inspiring grip and comfort.
Add it all up and it makes the Reaction 240 TM a fully featured junior mountain bike, with absolutely no compromises.
<br /><br />Cutting corners isn't Cube's way.
It's the reason that their junior frames use the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes that you'll find in their adult bikes, as well as the same mechanical tube forming process to adjust tube shapes for the best combination of strength and weight.
A low top tube - and geometry tailored to provide a blend of confidence-inspiring stability and fun-enhancing ridigity - work together to make the Reaction 240 TM both zippy and safe.
Your child will love it and you will too, safe in the knowledge that Cube has sweated the details.
A replaceable derailleur hanger means that little accidents needn't result in a large repair bill, and Cube's engineering team made room for wide tyres for the best in grip, comfort and safety.
<p>If you enjoy exploring off the beaten path, the Nature EXC is designed with you in mind.
<br /><br />Newly refined for 2019, the Nature EXC has one of the stiffest and lightest frames in its class according to Cube.
<p>If you fancy the idea of leaving your competition in the dust, the Reaction C:62 SL is good starting point.
<br /><br />Light, efficient, comfortable, agile: those are the requirements of a successful cross-country race frame.
<p>If you're looking for just the right blend of comfort and performance in a mountain bike, the Access WS EXC will fit the bill very nicely.
Featuring Cube's well-regarded Access frame - tweaked and refined for 2019 and with the Size Split system so every rider can find her perfect fit - it also boasts a great selection of components chosen for their performance, ease of use and reliability.
For example, the Suntour suspension fork doesn't just improve comfort and control, but also features a remote lockout for bob-free climbing.
The wide-ranging Shimano 24 speed transmission puts the right gear for any occasion at your fingertips, while the Tektro hydraulic disc brakes ensure you're always in full control, no matter what the weather throws at you.
Contact points are designed specifically for female riders, ensuring the best possible fit and all-day comfort.
<br /><br />For every frame that comes out of Cube's design studios their engineering team has a simple set of goals: great handling, great fit and great performance.
Revised and refined for 2019, the Access WS EXC's frame's sleek looks hide an array of neat touches.
For example, Cube has tweaked the rack and mudguard mounting points, improving their looks and ease of use so that you can add the accessories that are just right for you.
The dropped top tube gives more standover clearance for improved confidence on tricky trails, and Cube's Compact Agile Ride Geometry puts everything in exactly the right place for the best comfort and control.
Combined with the redesigned down tube's stiff, light and strong backbone, it all adds up to a ride position that's perfectly tuned for the keen rider - well-balanced, agile and comfortable.
Internal cable routing dramatically even reduces the need for maintenance, with the bonus of complementing the frame's sleek looks.
Because who wants to fiddle with their bike, when you could just be riding?</p>
<p>If you've been looking for the best in lightweight, race-bred hardtails, your search is over.
<br /> <br /> Perfectionism comes with the job at CUBE's engineering department.
<p>In our experience, women like to shred the trails just as hard as men.
Why wouldn't you?
It's fun, after all.
That's why we developed the Sting 120 EXC - an affordable, adaptable trail bike built specificallly for female riders.
With a lightweight frame, easy to adjust Suntour air suspension fork and air shock, powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and Shimano Deore drivetrain, it's got everything you need to take your trail riding to the next level.
From a short trail centre spin to a long day out in the mountains, you'll surprise yourself how 120 mm of front and rear travel can open up new horizons.
And, with our clever Size Split system, every rider can find her perfect fit.
What's stopping you?<br /> <br /> The latest incarnation of our proven Sting full suspension platform, the Sting 120 EXC features a triple butted 7005 Superlite aluminium tubeset for low weight and superb stiffness, and Agile Ride Geometry for great handling.
Details like the tapered steerer and thru axles – 12 mm at the rear and 15 mm at the front - go a long way to improve steering and tracking accuracy on even the bumpiest of trails.
Ride where you like, the Sting 120 EXC will go exactly where you point it.
Internal cable routing matches the frame's clean looks and ensures you can spend your time riding, rather than tweaking your gears.
And that complex profile top tube doesn't just look good, it also improves standover clearance for better maneuverability, adds stiffness and reduces weight.
Which sounds a bit like multitasking, only more fun...

<br /><br /><b>BENCHMARK</b><br />Years of feedback from numerous professional racers have made the MARES what it is: the cyclocross reference</p><p><b>WELL THOUGHT-OUT</b><br /> Often small things decide victory and defeat.
The specially developed FOCUS CX Chainguide prevents the chain from falling off.
</p><p><b>PRACTICAL</b><br />Faster and easier:
Thanks to the patented FOCUS R.A.T. removable axle, the wheel can be changed in less than ten seconds.
<br /><br /><b>R.A.T.
- Rapid Axle Technology </b><br />R.A.T. stands for Rapid Axle Technology.
It's the first removable axle system that combines the stability and lateral rigidity of a removable axle with an extremely fast wheel change.
The patented system is available for all road and cyclocross models with disc brakes as well as on the FOCUS Race MTBs O1E and Raven.
<br /><br /><b>SSPS - Stable Stiffness per Size </b><br />so that all wheel sizes offer the same quality, all offered frame heights are individually constructed.
<br /><br /><b>BB Pressfit 30</b><br />Pressfit 30 combines the advantages of BB30 and Pressfit bottom brackets.
Pressfit 30 has a pre-assembled seal in the shells to extend bearing life.
<p>Life doesn't always stop for you to maintain your bike.
That's why Cube worked hard to make sure that the Town Pro is easy to live with - because you need a bike that's comfortable, versatile and always ready to grab and go.
Cube started with a stylish frame design, added a set of components chosen for their reliability - like the easy-to-use Shimano 8 speed rear hub and Suntour suspension fork - and finished with convenient features like a built-in kickstand, luggage rack, lights and mudguards.
Now when you need a bike to get to work, run to the shops or just head out for some fresh air, the Town Pro will always be ready.
<br /><br />The Town Pro's light, stable aluminium frame features the same kind of double butted Superlite tubes that are used in many of Cube's more expensive bikes.
They're there to save weight where it's not needed, making for an easier and more comfortable ride without compromising strength or durability.
The refined luggage carrier is stable and sleek, so you can just strap on your load and go.
Internal cable routing reduces maintenance, and Cube built two different versions - a classic double diamond men's frame and a step-through frame for easy entry.
Featuring a stiff, light and strong main frame tube manufactured using the advanced hydroforming process, it's as refined and comfortable as you'd expect from a Cube.
<p>Looking for one bike to do it all?
<br /><br />The Aim Allroad shares many of its features with Cube's most sophisticated frames.
<p>Many adventurers and travellers regard Kathmandu as the adventure capital of the world.

The Axial GTC Pro takes things up a notch or two.
A thoroughbred race machine with performance in its DNA, it's built around Cube's lightweight twin mold carbon fibre frame.
With a light, stiff and strong Mavic Aksium wheelset, grippy Continental tyres and Shimano's legendary 2x11 105 transmission, it's equipped to perform.
Powerful Shimano 105 brakes deliver perfect modulation in any weather conditions for that competitive edge, because better brakes really can help you go faster.
All that's missing is the open road... and you.
<br /><br />The Axial GTC Pro might be the little sister to Cube's range-topping race bikes, but it's still packed with high-tech features and the same attention to detail.
The oversized main frame tubes maximise frame rigidity for superb steering precision - good for confidence, and good for speed too.
Meanwhile slim seatstays and the carbon fork help to filter out vibration from the road surface, meaning that you can stay comfortable even on longer rides.
The Twin Mould construction process enables Cube to precisely control frame strength, optimising stiffness and compliance to maximise pedalling performance and minimise rider fatigue.
The geometry is designed to put you in a high performance ride position for the best efficiency and lively, exciting handling - and internal cable routing minimises clutter and keeps your gear shifts cleaner for longer, without the need for regular maintenance.
<p>Representing a halfway point between a kid's bike and a full-sized adult's mountain bike, the Access 240 is the deal choice for a growing rider who wants to keep up with her friends and parents.
<br /><br />When Cube's engineers set out to design the Access 240, they began with the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes used in Cube's adult frames.
<p>Representing a halfway point between a kid's bike and a full-sized adult's mountain bike, the Acid 240 is the deal choice for growing riders who want to keep up with their friends and parents.
<br /><br />When Cube's engineers set out to design the Acid 240, they began with the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes used in the adult frames.
<p>Safety for parents and fun for the kids, all rolled into a single bike.
Too good to be true?
Not at all.
Meet the Ella 240 - a street-wise kid's mountain bike that's as well suited to daily use as it is to occasional trail ride fun with the family at the weekends.
Safety features include a dynamo-powered lighting system, so your child can see and be seen without any worry about running out of power.
Added functionality comes courtesy of the included luggage carrier, mudguards and kickstand.
And, when it comes to exploring further afield, the 21 speed Shimano gear system gives your junior rider all the gears she needs to tackle any hill.
Cube reckons you really can have your cake and eat it.
<br /><br />No cut corners, no excuses.
The Ella 240 features the same heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame tubes used in Cube's adult bikes, and goes through the same rigourous in-house testing process to ensure that it's more than strong and durable enough for the job.
That kind of attention to detail means two things.
First, you've got the peace of mind of knowing that your young rider is as safe as they can be on a bike that's been beautifully engineered.
And second, it just rides better.
Combined with geometry tailored specifically for younger riders and a confidenc-boosting easy-entry frame, it's the perfect foundation for long, fun-filled rides.
Meet the Kid 240 Street - a street-safe kid's mountain bike that's as well suited to daily use as it is to occasional trail ride fun with the family at the weekends.

<p>Sporty touring riders who occasionally ride more demanding trails will find the SDURO FullNine 6.0 an eFully with a high fun factor:
<p>That real mountain bike feeling, with an extra dose of power.
That's the Access Hybrid ONE's raison d'etre - and for 2018 Cube has gone to town and made it even better than before.
With a new frame boasting sleeker looks and better handling, Cube has selected Bosch's powerful CX drive unit and paired it with a wide-ranging Shimano 9 speed transmission so that you can tackle any climb with ease.
Strong Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide consistent stopping power in any weather, and the 100 mm RST suspension fork takes the sting out of the bumps, so that you can concentrate on the ride.
And, with Cube's Size Split system, you can be sure of finding the perfect fit.
<br /><br /><b>Frame</b><br />Key to the Access Hybrid ONE's easy-on-the-eye appearance is the one piece, gravity cast down tube.
Incorporating both the battery and the drive unit, it's the bike's rigid backbone as well as a superbly elegant piece of engineering.
It also lowers the centre of gravity for improved handling, and you don't even need to remove the battery for charging.
Agile Ride Geomtery (ARG) continues to set the standard for e-mtb handling, offering the perfect blend of confidence-inspiring stability and fun liveliness.
And internal cable routing means that your gears will continue to work perfectly with almost no maintenance.
Easy to live with, easy to ride, designed specifically to meet female riders' needs and great looking too - that's the Access Hybrid ONE in a nutshell.
<p>The Access 240 Disc is the bike that all youngsters will want.
Light, strong and equipped with everything they'll need to kepp up with friends and family, it's got all the features that you'll find on Cube's adult mountain bikes.
So the brakes are powerful and easy to control hydraulic discs with levers especially designed for smaller hands, offering plenty of power for early trail adventures.
There's a Suntour suspension fork to improve comfort and control on rough surfaces, and Cube fitted a Shimano 7 speed gear system with Velo grip controls and a wide-ranging cassette to bring every hill, up or down, within reach.
And, of course, the heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame is built with the same attention to detail that you'd expect from Cube.
<br /><br />When Cube's engineers set out to design the Access 240 Disc, they began with the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes used in Cube's adult frames.
<p>The all new Cubie 180 brings the V brake system of a real mountain bike to a perfectly proportioned, lightweight aluminium frame designed especially for budding little rippers.
<br /><br />Kids may be small, but they're capable of giving a bike frame a really hard time simply through their enthusiasm, energy and the process of learning by making mistakes.
<p>The Attention is the kind of bike that'll redefine your expectations.
<br /><br />The high quality 6061 aluminium frame - with mechanically formed top and down tubes and internal cable routing for cleaner looks and longer-lasting smooth shifting with minimal maintenance - is a good example of the attention to detail Cube lavish on all their designs.
<p>The Axial C:62 SL's combination of the best frame materials and the finest components makes it the perfect choice for the racer in you, whether you're battling for position in the peloton or duking it out with your training buddies.
You don't need to compromise, because Cube didn't either.
The frame features their premium C:62 carbon for the ultimate in low weight and exceptional stiffness, and it's matched by a full C:62 carbon fork up front.
Shimano's 2x11 Ultegra transmission serves up flawless gear shifts every time, while matching hydraulic disc brakes offer perfect modulation and control in any weather conditions.
Throw in the light, stiff and strong Newmen wheelset and grippy, fast-rolling Continental tyres, and you've got all the ingredients for a supremely quick, agile and light race machine.
<br /><br />This is pure, high-end carbon frame construction.
Their Advanced Twin Mould monocoque technology gives Cube full control over fibre lay-up during construction, so they can fine-tune every area of the frame to optimise both weight and stiffness.
The icing on the cake is Cube's premium C:62 carbon, which has the strength to enable them to build such a lightweight yet exceptionally fast chassis.
Oversized main tubes and chainstays - combined with a tapered head tube, extremely stiff bottom bracket and 12 mm thru axles front and rear - are instrumental in achieving a stiffness-to-weight ratio that's the envy of Cube's competitors.
Controlled flex in the seat stays, a flattened top tube and the carbon fork blades all add comfort without compromising efficiency, so you'll be able to ride at your full potential on even the longest of races or training days.
And, of course, internal cable routing minimises maintenance, maximises gear change precision... and complements the frame's stunning looks.
<p>The Axial Pro Disc bridges the gap between performance racer and comfortable, long distance tourer.
An impossible compromise?
Not for Cube.
Carefully tweaked geometry creates a relaxed, efficient ride position - and, combined with a carbon fork and comfort-enhancing Flex Stays, it makes the Axial Pro a great companion for the long haul.
Cube's design team chose the precise, reliable Shimano Sora transmission for its wide range and easy, intuitive gear shifting, and then added Tektro Spyre disc brakes with large 160 mm rotors for powerful, consistent braking in any weather conditions.
Put it all together and you've got a bike that offers the aspiring racer everything she needs to experience the best that narrow tyres and performance riding have to offer.
<br /><br />The holy grail for a frame engineer is the perfect combination of low weight - for comfort and speed - and just the right stiffness - for accurate steering and efficient pedalling.
With the Axial Pro, the search is over.
Details like the oversized, cross-ovalised down tube, tapered head tube, PressFit bottom bracket and 3D forged dropouts all contribute to its performance, but Cube hasn't forgotten the importance of comfort.
From the balanced ride position to the vibration absorbing carbon fork and Flex Stays, they've ensured that you'll stay comfortable, even on the longest rides.
Internal cable routing greatly reduces the need for maintenance, improves gear shifting accuracy and perfectly complements the frame's elegant appearance.
Long-distance comfort and genuine high performance, brought together in one frame.
<p>The Cubie 120 walk is designed to ease your little one into the wonderful world of bikes, building confidence in a fun and safe way.
Despite its simple appearance, it's stacked with Cube's usual attention to detail.
A special heatset setup - with integrated steering angle limite - helps prevent accidents caused by over-enthusiastic steering.
There's a carry handle integrated into the seat, so that you can scoop up the Cubie 120 walk and carry it easily when your child's adventurous spirit has waned.
Cube even included a second seatpost and saddle combo, to allow for plenty of growth.
Proper pneumatic tyres provide comfort, roll easily and help make the ride fun.
The aluminium fork is light and strong, just like the frame.
As for the lack of brakes... well, experience has shown that kids this young don't have the finger strength and coordination required to brake safely, which is why this is a bike that's both propelled and stopped by your child's feet.
It's the ideal way to discover the fine art of balancing, to build confidence and to generate enthusiasm for the joy of riding bikes.
<br /><br />This is a simple little bike that's reduced to the bare essentials, but that doesn't mean that Cube's engineering team slacked off.
Far from it.
The 6061 aluminium chassis and fork are really light, and perfectly proportioned for small children.
For example, low standover allows lots of freedom of movement for their first attempts at riding, which helps build confidence.
For safety's sake, Cube made sure that all frame parts are finished with smooth edges and corners.
It's all your little one needs to start their biking adventure.

For safety's sake, Cube made sure that all frame parts are finished with smooth edges and corners.
<p>The Elite C:62 Race is an uncompromisingly high performance carbon speed machine with an emphasis on low weight - but that doesn't mean that Cube is sacrificing versatility on the altar of outright speed.
<br /><br />Cube's advanced twin mold technology gives their design team the best possible control over the lay-up of Cube's premium C:62 carbon fibre, resulting in a frame that's both light and stiff.
<p>The Ella Cruise will slot so easily into your life, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.
Elegant and refined with its signature retro styling cues, it blends effortless style with genuine practicality and ease of use.
The frame isn't just about great looks, it's also designed to be super easy to step in and out of.
A comfortable ride position and safe, intuitive handling are part of the package, as are components that are designed to work effortlessly and reliably, so you can just concentrate on the ride.
With a stable carrier, mudguards, kickstand and a lighting set, you'll be ready for any two wheeled journey.
<br /><br />The Ella Cruise's light, strong, step-through frame is great news for anyone looking for an easy-to-live-with bike, but a conundrum for Cube's engineers.
Luckily, they're up for a challenge.
The elegantly curved down tube is great looking, but also stiff and strong for safety.
In the search for the ideal blend of form and function, Cube designed neat luggage rack mounts to blend in with the frame's curves.
Combined with the colour-coordinated accessories and internal cable routing, it all adds up to a bike that's as easy on the eye as it is to ride.
And, as you'd expect, the Efficient Comfort Geometry means that you're in the best possible position for both comfort and easy pedalling, making every journey a pleasure.
<p>The Hornet CLVR City Scooter from Hudora not only looks good, it also rides really well.

<br /><br />Cube's engineers set great store by safety and stability.
But Cube also understand that people who are always active want more than just safety - they want performance, too.
That's why the Nature EXC Allroad's frame is built from high quality, double butted aluminium tubes - to save weight where it's not needed and provide a light, lively ride.
Neat features like internally routed cables help reduce maintenance, while the newly redesigned luggage carrier and mudguards mounting points integrate almost seamlessly into the frame so that accessories don't spoil its clean lines.

<br /><br />The Touring's light, double butted aluminium frame features Cube's renowned Efficient Comfort Geometry, specifically developed for touring bikes.
It's tailored to provide the most comfortable possible riding position with the best energy transfer, so that long days in the saddle become a pleasure rather than a chore.
Cube even developed two different verions.
There`s the trapeze frame with it`s sportier looks in a classic format, while the classic men's frame finishes off the duo of options.
The luggage carrier has a sleek, easy-to-use mounting system - and, of course, there's still provision for bottle mounts and Cube's ingeniously simple Easy Mount kickstand.
Cables are routed internally, which cleans up the bike's looks and greatly reduces the need for maintenance.
It's details like this that make the difference... so that you can concentrate on the ride.
<p>The Touring Pro has two standout features.
First, of course, there's its high quality aluminium frame.
Light, comfortable and efficient for even long days in the saddle, it'll win you over the moment you turn the pedals for the first time.
Second, there's its powerful hydraulic disc brake system.
They slow you down safely and reliably, whatever the weather's doing.
And that's an important consideration, whether you're an everyday rider braving the traffic on the way to work or an occasional tourer, exploring at the weekends.
Combined with the reliable 24 speed Shimano transmission, a full complement of mudguards, rear luggage carrier and a built-in lighting system, it's the perfect companion for many, many miles of riding pleasure.
<br /><br />So that you can be confident of finding precisely the right bike for your needs, Cube designed the Touring Pro with three frames.
The classic men's diamond frame is available in five different sizes, while the sporty-looking trapeze version comes in three sizes as well as the comfortable easy entry frame.
All models benefit from luggage carriers with a sleek mounting system, which complements the svelte appearance and minimal maintenance of the internally routed cables.
And, of course, Cube used their lightweight double butted frame tubes for the optimum blend of low weight, efficient power transfer and surprising comfort.
It's all wrapped up in Cube's Efficient Comfort Geometry, which delivers on its promise of inspiring handling and a comfortable ride position for long days in the saddle.

What more could you want?</p>
<p>There are those who will tell you that one bike can't do it all.
All that Cube will say is, they clearly haven't tried the Cross Allroad.
Blending the sophisticated frame design of Cube's Cross series with the added functionality of full length mudguards with a built-in rear light and a hub dynamo, this is a bike that's capable of tackling everything from the daily commute to extended weekend excursions.
Shimano's slick, reliable 10 speed transmission is backed up by the powerful all-weather stopping ability of hydraulic disc brakes and the comfort of a SR Suntour NCX suspension fork.
All roads, all weather, all season: the Cross Allroad is the bike for all reasons.
<br /><br />The Cross Allroad shares its careful design and advanced frame features with its Cross stablemates.
Double butted aluminium frame tubes save weight and improve ride quality without sacrificing either strength or stiffness.
Internally routed cables look neat, improve gear performance over the long term and significantly reduce maintenance.
Cube hasn't forgotten looks, either.
New for 2019, the luggage carrier and mudguard mounting points were redesigned to integrate them even more seamlessly into the frame, so that accessories don't spoil the clean lines of your bike.
And Cube's Smooth Welding technology helps give the appearance of one tube flowing into the next for a svelte, almost organic experience.
All that Cube will say is, they clearly haven't tried the Cross Allroad.
Blending the sophisticated frame design of Cube's Cross series with the added functionality of full length mudguards with a built-in rear light and a hub dynamo, this is a bike that's capable of tackling everything from the daily commute to extended weekend excursions.
And Cube's Smooth Welding technology helps give the appearance of one tube flowing into the next for a svelte, almost organic experience.
<p>There are times in life when only the best will do - and this is one of them.
The Access WS C:62 SL is unapologetically uncompromising.
Fast, light, nimble and responsive, every detail is designed to help you extract the absolute maximum from your time on the trail.
With its stiff, light and lively carbon chassis, it would have been rude of us not to select the very best components.
So that's what we did.
Sram's GX Eagle transmission serves up 12 perfectly spaced gears with an enormous range, positive shifting and incredibly simple operation.
Shimano's XT hydraulic disc brakes offer unparalleled stopping power - with a little help from the light, stiff and strong Fulcrum Red 55 wheels and grippy Schwalbe tyres.
And the RockShox Reba air suspension fork with remote lockout is a superbly accomplished rock swallower, giving you more speed, greater comfort and better control.
We even included Newmen Evolution cockpit components - and the Size Split system means that, no matter how tall you are, there's an Access WS C:62 SL that will fit you perfectly.
The only thing left to do is to decide where you're going to ride next...
<br /> <br /> Built from our high quality C:62 carbon, our engineering team's goal with the Access WS C:62 SL was a simple one: to build the lightest, stiffest and best handling women's hardtail that they possibly could.
It's why they started with a short rear end incorporating a Boost thru axle - because efficient pedalling and accurate steering are the cornerstone of any great mountain bike.
Our Agile Ride Geometry adds the lively, nimble and safe feel you'd expect from a CUBE, and the slender 27.2 mm seatpost and slim seatstays improve comfort over rough surfaces, so won't get beaten up even on long rides.
There's a PressFit bottom bracket and integrated headset to save weight, while the internally routed cables keep dust, dirt and water from messing up your gear changes - and mean you can spend more time riding, and less time maintaining your bike.
Want to push your boundaries?
We even thought of that, with routing for a simple dropper post upgrade.
<p>There's no getting away from the reality: getting around town quickly and easily these days means a switch from cars to bikes.
The advantages of two wheels are obvious - they're fast, stress-free and good for you.
But anyone contemplating the switch needs a bike geared towards the specific demands of the urban environment.
That's where the Hyde comes in. With its light frame and reliable components, this svelte urban machine is the ideal companion for tackling city streets in comfort.
From the powerful hydraulic disc brakes' all-weather stopping power to the fast-rolling tyres and slick-shifting Shimano 27 speed transmission, it's all the bike you need to beat the traffic across town.
More than that, it's light and lively enough to do double duty as your weekend ticket out into the countryside.
One bike, many reasons: that's the Hyde.
<br /><br />Looking for inspiraiton for their urban mile-muncher, Cube's engineers borrowed tech and experience from their light, fast and versatile 29er mountain bike range.
The sleek rigid fork matches the frame's understated looks perfectly and offers, crisp, precise steering alongside its low weight.
Space for two drink bottles means long weekend rides are well within your reach, and Cube even reduced the need for maintenance by routing gear cables internally.

Allow Cube to introduce the Axial GTC SL Disc - the ideal bike for riders who appreciate how great equipment can help bring out her best performance.
Built around are Axial GTC frame's renowned handling and long distance performance, Cube added a selection of the best components to ensure that you're always riding at your peak.
Smooth, wide-ranging Shimano Ultegra gears, powerful Shimano 105 hydraulic disc brakes for all-weather performance - with STI levers specially shaped for smaller hands - and light, stiff and strong Fulcrum Racing 66 wheels all combine to extract the very best from the high tech carbon frame - and, more importantly, from you.
Light, fast and comfortable: the Axial GTC is all three of these, perfected.
<br /> <br /> The Axial GTC SL's carbon frame, precision-manufactured using Cube's Twin Mold technology, has a perfect stiffness-to-weight ratio designed specifically to maximize your performance.
Oversized main frame tubes join with an extra large cross-section at the head tube for superb steering precision.
They also provide an exceptionally rigid backbone for the rest of the frame and this, combined with 12mm thru-axles front and rear, delivers instantaneous pedaling response.
Thin seat stays and vibration-absorbing carbon fork blades add a noticeable dose of extra comfort in spite of this efficiency, keeping you comfortable even for the long haul.
And, although Cube included the awesome modulation and stopping power of disc brakes, they made sure to integrate them into the frame's elegant lines using the Flat Mount standard and some clever design from their engineering team.
Add the performance-orientated geometry with a stretched, efficient ride position and you have everything you need to realize your full potential.
<p>We developed the Sting 120 Pro for women who ride that little bit further, that little bit faster... and that little bit more adventurously.
With 120 mm of suspension travel front and rear, agile handling and smooth, reliable components, it's the perfect trail companion for riders looking for a little extra.
The easy to adjust RockShox Sektor air suspension fork works in tandem with the Manitou Radium Expert rear shock to take the sting out of the bumps, Shimano's XT drivetrain shifts crisply and reliably and powerful Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes ensure you're always in full control.
Plus, our Size Split system means that every rider can find her perfect fit, thanks to a range of sizes spanning from 13.5 inch with 27.5 inch wheels to 19 inch with 29er wheels.
There's literally a Sting 120 Pro to suit everyone...
<br /> <br /> What our engineers don't know about designing great full suspension bikes could be written on the back of a postage stamp.
That's how we've been able to give the Sting 120 Pro all the features it needs to excel out on the trail.
From the triple butted 7005 series aluminium Superlite tubes - for low weight and excellent stiffness - to the Agile Ride Geometry's quick, intuitive handling, everything here serves a purpose.
A 12 mm thru axle at the rear and 15 mm up front complement the tapered steerer tube for better steering accuracy and tracking on rough trails and, as you'd expect, cables are routed internally for low maintenance and to preserve the frame's stunning good looks.
<p>What do you need in an adventure touring bike?
Cube made their own list and built the Kathmandu SL around it: light, stiff, strong, versatile, reliable... and, above all, comfortable.
The IC luggage carrier combines with Cube's aluminium Superlite double butted frame to make a formidable load-carrying companion for any adventure, big or small.
Decked out with Shimano's ultra-reliable XT transmission for a wide range of slick-shifting gears - plus matching hydraulic disc brakes for fast, safe stopping on any road - it's all you need to broaden your horizons.
With a RockShox fork to smooth out the roughest of roads and a Selle Royal saddle for day-long comfort, it's Cube's ultimate bike-for-all-reasons.
<br /><br />When curiosity takes you further afield you need a frame that's up to the task.
The Kathmandu SL combines stability, strength and comfort thanks to a double butted frame that removes weight from areas where it's safe to do so, and adds material where it's needed for safety.
Internally routed cables keep your gear shifts silky smooth for longer, reducing maintenance and contributing to the frame's sleek looks.
Speaking of which, Cube's IC luggage carrier blends its structure seamlessly into the frame's, combining ease of use and superb strength and stability with an elegance that's often missing from a touring bike.
There is no lighter, stiffer or stronger luggage rack, period.
<p>What happens if you take a trail-munching hardtail and equip it with the best of the best?
</p><p>The Reaction TM Race makes use of all Cube’s aluminium frame building know-how to make a frame that's fast, light and tough as nails.
<p>What inspires you?
For Cube it's making the best possible bikes - and that's where the Access WS SL comes in. Designed and built so that you can push your boundaries out on the trail, it's the inspiration you need to ride further, faster and in greater comfort than before.
With a revised frame for 2019, Cube has worked hard to build a bike that's light, fast, safe, reliable... and above all, easy to live with.
The superb 2x11 Shimano XT and SLX gear components put every climb within reach, while powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with light, grippy Schwalbe tyres and a RockShox Recon Silver air fork - with remote dropout - ensure you're always in full control.
Whatever your passion - race, relax, or just trail exploring with your riding buddies - you'll get more from it with the Access WS SL.
<br /><br />Frame building technologies are evolving constantly, but Cube's engineers are at the top of their game.
For 2019 the Access WS SL features a PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube, for added pedalling efficiency and steering precision.
Agile Ride Geometry means you can rely on the kind of balanced-but-lively handling for which Cube is renowned - you can take it easy or go full throttle, whatever floats your boat.
From the safety point of view, you can rest assured that it's passed Cube's stringent in-house testing for strength and durability.
And thanks to Cube's durable, multi-layer paint finish, your Access WS SL will keep its good looks for years to come, no matter how hard you ride.

<p>When the open road beckons, you'll need a bike that's comfortable, versatile, safe and fun to ride.
Cube's Touring ticks all those boxes, combining a lightweight aluminium frame with all the features you need to enjoy your cycling, wherever the road takes you.
From the slick-shifting Shimano gears to the lightweight, powerful brakes and comfortable ride position, it's a bike that you'll take to immediately.
Cube included a neat luggage carrier, full length mudguards, a kickstand and a lighting system too, so you're fully equipped for any eventuality.
The only remaining question is, where will you ride tomorrow?<br /><br />There are three qualities at the forefront of Cube's engineers' minds when they're developing a touring bike: comfort, control and safety.
All three versions of the Touring - Easy Entry, Trapeze and classic Men's - are designed to offer low weight, easy handling and the reassurance of having passed Cube's strict in-house safety testing.
Double butted aluminium frame tubes save weight wherever possible while ensuring strength at critical points, and the Efficient Comfort Geometry ensures that you'll be comfortable and in full control, even on the longest rides.
Finishing touches include internally routed cables, for a tidier appearance and dramatically reduced maintenance.
Because Cube's entire focus is on keeping you riding - and smiling - for mile after mile.
<p>When the urge to explore further afield becomes too much to resist, you'll need a partner in crime - or, at the very least, a bike that'll be with you for every turn of the pedals.
Have you met the Access WS Pro?
It's built for the job.
Light, comfortable and well-equipped, it's a bike that's as good to ride as it is to look at.
Cube has built the frame around two different wheel sizes so that every rider can find her perfect fit, from the 13.5 inch frame with 27.5 inch wheels to the 19 inch 29er.
Whichever one you choose, the light and grippy Schwalbe Smart Sam 2.25 in tyres, combined with the remote lockout-equipped Suntour fork and powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, give you all the comfort and control you'll need to tackle any trail with confidence.
Smooth-shifting and wide-ranging Shimano gears will help you tackle even the steepest of climbs, and Cube selected the rider contact points - like grips, handlebar and saddle - specifically to fit the female form.
Get inspired, and get riding... on the Access WS Pro.
That's why Cube's engineers designed the Access WS Pro's frame around the Compact Agile Ride Geometry - to give it the best blend of poise, comfort and agility backed with Cube's comprehensive in-house testing for complete peace of mind.
Revised rack and mudguard mounting points match the frame's sleek looks and make adding these functional accessories a cinch, while internal cable routing keeps gear shifting clean and accurate without the need for regular maintenance.
<p>When you buy the Cube Travel, the adventure comes free with the bike.
By combining a lightweight, comfortable frame based around 29er wheels with an semi-integrated luggage carrier for neater looks and more secure load carrying, Cube has created a consummate all-rounder.
Whatever the scale of your adventure - from a trip to the coffee shop to a longer route out into the hills - it's the ideal companion.
There's loads of clearance for wide, grippy and comfortable tyres, the 3x9 speed Shimano gears and hydraulic disc brakes are smooth and reliable, and it's equipped with all the accessories you need for comfortable two-wheeled exploration.
You can look at this way:
The Travel is your gateway to cycling freedom...
<br /><br />A bike that's going to accompany your adventures needs to be strong, comfortable and safe.
That's why Cube selected double butted aluminium tubes, which combine strength and rigidity with low weight for the optimal blend of stiffness, durablity and comfort.
State of the art technology includes a tapered head tube for improved steering precision, and Cube used their Smooth Welding process throughout for a clean, organic look to the frame tubes.
The result is a lively and efficient ride feel that translates into easy handling and smooth, effortless forward progress.
The semi-integrated luggage carrier complements the Travel's clean leans and provides super stable load carrying ability for whatever you need to bring along with you.
There are some neat details, like an Easy Mount kickstand and a complete set of bottle cage bosses.
And, of course, the Travel has passed all of Cube's stringent tests in their own in-house laboratory, so you can ride with the reassurance of knowing that your Travel won't let you down.
<p>When your riding aspirations stretch further than your local trail centre, you'll want a bike that can match them.
That's why we developed the Access WS C:62 Pro - a carbon-framed hardtail for women who live and ride adventurously.
You'll love the sleek looks and light weight, but this bike's beauty is more than skin deep.
Carefully selected components include the smooth-shifting, wide-ranging and ultra-reliable Shimano XT 2x11 gears - which put every climb within reach.
Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure you can keep your speed in check no matter what the weather or trail conditions, while grippy and fast-rolling Schwalbe tyres work in harmony with the RockShox Recon Silver air suspension fork to smooth the trail.
We even incorporated our Size Split system, so every rider can find her perfect fit.
Low weight, beautiful design and fantastic performance: you really can have it all.
</p><p>Everything we've learnt about building great handling, lightweight carbon hardtails is ploughed into the Access WS C:62 Pro's frame.
Starting with our premium C:62 carbon, our engineers designed a short and stiff rear triangle - complete with Boost axle - for efficient pedalling.
The result is superb tracking and steering, sharp acceleration and, combined with our Agile Ride Geometry, inspiring handling all round.
A PressFit bottom bracket and integrated headset make the most of the weight savings we've finessed, while slim seatstays and a slender 27.2mm seatpost help take some of the buzz out of the trail - good news if you like to ride not just hard, but long too.
Internal cable routing complements the frame's organic lines, but also keeps gear shifts smooth without the need for regular maintenance.
We even included an easy upgrade option to a stealth dropper post, so you can keep riding when the trail gets super-steep.
It's all in the detail...
<p>Where can you find a roadworthy kid's bike that's also ideal for family trail rides?
<br /><br />Cube's engineers sweat the details on every frame they design, whether it's destined for a World Cup racer or an enthusiastic junior rider who's just finding their cycling feet.
<br /><br />Cube's engineers sweat the details on every frame they design, whether it's destined for a World Cup racer or an enthusiastic junior rider who's just finding their cycling feet.
<p>Whether you're exploring distant countries or just want to commute to work, the SDURO Trekking 3.5 Ladies is ready for every trip.
<p>Why should adults get to have all the fun?
<br /><br />Cube is not going to bore you with all the details, but let's just say that fitting the Bosch drive system and battery into a mountain bike frame suitable for kids isn't as straightforward as Cube's engineers have made it look.
All that's left to do is for your junior rider to jump on, and show the adults how it's done.
<p>Why wouldn't a young rider want to ride a bike in the colours of their favourite team?
<br /><br />When Cube's engineers set out to design the Kid 240, they began with the same kind of heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes that they use in their adult frames.
<p>With its interchangeable lens construction, uvex blaze III is made for any weather condition and provides 100% UV-protection guaranteed.
</p><p><b></b><b>Interchangeable Lens Construction</b><br />Always the right eyewear with the right lens. uvex’s foolproof interchangeable lens technology guarantees clear vision for every need.

<br /><br />Cube's engineers started with a geometry designed specifically around a child's needs, blending the fun of responsive handling with the safety of stable, predictable steering - just like on the adult range.
<p>With looks borrowed straight from Cube's mountain bike range and a design tailored specially for young riders, the Cubie 160 is the ideal introduction to the joys of pedal power.
<p>With the Attention SL Cube set out to create a new benchmark for value and performance.
<br /><br />Affordable it may be, but the Attention SL's 6061 aluminium frame - with mechanically formed top and down tubes - is anything but ordinary.
<p>You don't need to be a racer to appreciate the thinking behind the Race ONE - Cube's aim was simply to create a fast, agile, well-equipped hardtail.
<br /><br />What do you need in a great-handling, versatile hardtail?
<p>You know how it is - you're out for a ride and you just can't help taking the long route home, or trying out the turning you've never been down before.
The more ambitious you are with your riding, the more you expect out of your bike.
And that's where the Cross EXC comes in. A high quality, lightweight chassis, superb RockShox Paragon Gold air suspension fork and Shimano XT transmission and hydraulic disc brakes mean you've everything you need at your fingertips for longer, more adventurous rides.
We even redesigned the luggage carrier and mudguard mounts for a smoother, neater appearance - so you can accessorise your Cross EXC to meet your needs without spoiling its great looks.
Whether you're inspired by the idea of more adventurous routes or just want a bike that's as reliable as it is fun to ride, choose the Cross EXC... and ride like you mean it.
<br /><br />When they set out to design the Cross EXC's aluminium frame, our engineers set themselves an ambitious goal: to increase efficiency, stability and riding comfort, all whilst reducing weight.
That's why they chose a double butted aluminium tubeset and used our Smooth Welding technology at the joins, for a sleek, stiff and lightweight structure.
The intelligent way that the down tube meets the tapered head tube makes this area of the frame particularly stiff, improving steering precision and giving increased confidence in any riding situation.
Internal cable routing complements the frame's elegant lines while reducing the need for fiddly maintenance.
And we completely redesigned the mounting points for mudguards and luggage carrier, integrating them even more neatly into the frame so that you can add the accessories you need and still keep your Cross EXC's great looks.
Versatile, sleek, fast and fun: the Cross EXC is the definition of a cycling all-rounder.
<p>You know that saying, 'power is nothing without control?'
Cube took it to heart with the Access WS EAZ.
That's why it's equipped with powerful, easily-controllable Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and grippy, easy-rolling Schwalbe Smart Sam tyres.
With all that stopping power at your fingertips, you can concentrate on enjoying the ride - whatever the weather, or the conditions beneath your tyres.
And the best part?
A Suntour suspension fork helps smooth out the bumps, 24 easy-shifting Shimano gears mean you'll always be able to find the right gear for any trail and, like all Cube's WS bikes, their designers selected female-specific rider contact points for the best day-long comfort.
Thanks to the Size Split system, every rider can find her perfect fit.
<br /><br />You'll find the same attention to detail in the Access WS EAZ's frame as you would in, say, one of Cube's top-of-the-range race bikes.
That matters because it means you can trust your bike to perform to the same exacting standards of comfort, control, durability and safety.
Built around the Compact Agile Ride Geometry, the Access WS EAZ's frame is designed to offer the best possible fit for day-long ride comfort, as well as confidence-inspiring handling.
A slightly lowered top tube improves confidence by adding extra standover clearance, whilst a newly designed down tube provides the strong, rigid backbone that's essential for a stable ride and accurate steering.
Cube has tweaked the mudguard and rack mounting points to make them even neater than before, and cables run internally to keep them out of the way of the elements and to reduce maintenance.
And, of course, it's met and exceeded the exceptionally high standards Cube set in their own in-house torture-testing lab - so you can rest assured that it'll be a reliable, safe companion for years to come.
<p>You know what children are like - there comes a time when they want a bike just like Mum and Dad's.
<br /><br />The Acid 200 Disc's heat-treated 6061 aluminium frame has the same quality and durability as Cube's full-size mountain bikes.
<p>You might guess from the Access Race's name that it's got speed in its genes - and you'd be right.
But you don't need to go racing to get the benefit from its lightweight frame, intuitive handling or smooth, reliable components.
This is a bike that's designed for any woman with an adventurous streak, an urge to push her boundaries or to go in search of new personal goals.
With the benefit of Cube's Size Split system - so every rider can find her perfect fit - and a design team dedicated to ensuring the best possible handling, comfort and safety, it's the perfect tool to help you discover new trails to explore.
The Suntour air suspension fork features easy setup, low weight and smooth, bump-swallowing performance that improves both comfort and control.
Meanwhile, the wide-ranging and smooth-shifting 3x10 Shimano transmission puts the right gear for any eventuality literally at your fingertips - and the powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes and light, grippy Schwalbe tyres ensure you can always stop safely, no matter what the conditions.
Comfort, control and a whole heap of fun: you really can have it all.
<br /><br />The Access Race's frame is as refined as you'd expect.
Key to its performance is a 6061 aluminium chassis crafted from mechanically formed tubes, which allows Cube's engineers to save weight without sacrificing safety, strength or stiffness.
With a revised top and down tube for 2019, Cube has maximised standover clearance for improved confidence on rough trails, and ensured that the Compact Agile Ride Geometry delivers the ultimate blend of liveliness when you want it and stability when you need it.
New rack and mudguard mounting points are neater than ever, complementing the frame's sleek looks and the internally routed cables - which also mean less time spent maintaining your bike, and more time riding it.
Cube even improved comfort by selecting a slender 27,2 mm diameter seatpost and paying close attention to frame tube diameter and wall thickness, so that even long days in the saddle are a pleasure.
Put it all together, and it makes for a trail companion that you'll want to keep riding.
<br /><br />Cube's Reaction Pro frame was already well-regarded in the hardtail world.
<p>You might guess from the Reaction Pro's name that Cube is really getting down to business with this bike.
<p>You shouldn't have to modify a bike you've just bought for your child in order to make it safer on the road!
The package includes mudguards for wet weather, LED lights so that your child can see and be seen, and a front brake modulator to prevent over-enthusiastic braking resulting in an unfortunate accident.
Brake levers are specially designed for the shorter reach of children's hands, and the Shimano 7 speed gear system is easy to use and puts the right gear for any situation just a click or two away.
On top of all this, there's a Suntour suspension fork for noticeably better comfort and control on rough surfaces.
It's everything, in other words, that your young rider needs to conquer roads and trails with the same bike.
<br /><br />Young riders want to ride as fast as their skills allow.
That's why Cube developed the Access 240 Allroad's frame to be light, strong and confidence-inspiring.
Youth-specific geometry with a low top tube provides the ideal blend of agility and stability, while the mechanically formed, heat-treated 6061 aluminium tubes are exactly the same kind you'll find in Cube's full size frames.
The derailleur hanger - which can be damaged in a tumble - is easily replaceable.
It means that the kind of little accidents that are quite common needn't result in a big repair bill.
It's the reason Cube developed the Access 240 Allroad - the kind of mountain bike that kids have always wanted, with the safety features that allow parents to relax.
It's the reason Cube developed the Acid 240 Allroad - the kind of mountain bike that kids have always wanted, with the safety features that allow parents to relax.

The Touring ONE has everything you need for cycling - no more, no less.
The Touring's light, double butted aluminium frame features Cube's renowned Efficient Comfort Geometry, specifically developed for touring bikes.
Fun of longeivity?
The Travel Pro offers both!
It takes all the functionality, comfort and practicality of Cube's Travel series and adds an 8 speed hub gear and low-maintenance belt drive for the ultimate in hassle-free cycling.
No more oily chain, no more gear adjustment, no more worries!
There's also a semi-integrated luggage carrier to complement the frame's sleek looks and provide strong, stable support for whatever load you want to bring with you.
Cube included plenty of clearance for extra wide tyres, which offer loads of comfort and grip.
Add it all up, and you've got an adaptable, rugged and hassle-free riding partner... wherever your exploring takes you.
Cube built the Travel Pro's 29er-inspired frame from light, strong double butted tubing, using their Smooth Welding technology at the seat and head tube junctions for a tidy, organic appearance.
The result is the perfect blend of light and stiff.
The handling is superb even when the bike is fully laden thanks to the tapered head tube, which improves the steering precision of the rigid aluminium fork.
The semi-integrated luggage carrier matches the frame's clean looks as well as providing a strong and stable platform, no matter what load you're carrying.
Cube ensured that there's clearance for tyres up to 2.25in in both frame and fork, significantly improving comfort, puncture resistance and grip... so you can confidently ride wherever your curiosity takes you.
And internal cable routing is the ideal match for the Travel Pro's belt driven hub gears, reducing maintenance to practically zero.
Don't be deceived by its understated looks - the Travel SL is no ordinary sports tourer.
A lightweight machine built around Shimano's low maintenance 8 speed hub gear and Gates' durable belt drive, it makes rattling gears, oily chains and regular maintenance distant memories rather than constant irritations.
Wherever you're headed and whatever load you're carrying, the near-indestructible drive belt and smooth simplicity of the hub gears mean you can concentrate on the adventure, and stop worrying about the bike.
With powerful hydraulic disc brakes, low rider front rack compatibility and a full complement of touring gear - including kickstand, lights and mudguards - it's the ideal lightweight, round-the-world companion.
This classically elegant frame design features double butted aluminium tubes for the best combination of low weight, high strength and great ride quality.

Cube's top-flight cross-country race machine resets the bar for riders seeking the fastest, stiffest and lightest bike to help them achieve their goals.
Building on the proven efficiency of their well established four bar suspension platform, Cube's engineers designed the AMS 100 C:68 Race 29's chassis around their proprietary C:68 featherweight carbon technology for the ultimate combination of pace, comfort and performance.
With superb Newmen cockpit components, a lightweight Fulcrum Red 55 wheelset and Shimano's peerless XT transmission and brakes, there's everything the aspiring podium-chaser needs to help realise their ambitions.
It's a good thing Cube's engineers relish a challenge.
The AMS 100's blend of low weight, ground-hugging suspension and supreme efficiency is a touch balancing act to get right.
With the Advanced Twin Mold technology and C:68 carbon, Cube was able to create a cross-country frame that combines all those qualities with beautifully sleek good looks.
Exceptional stiffness is given a helping hand with features like the tapered head tube and Boost 148 rear end, while the stealth appearance is complemented by Di2 compatability and concealed bolts and bearings.
It's not just incredibly fast on the trail, it looks fast standing still.
At Cube they believe you shouldn't always judge a book by its cover.
That's why, with the brand new AMS 100 C:68 TM 29, they've blended the race-ready performance of the AMS 100 platform with trail-ready components like a 120 mm travel Fox 34 fork, remote dropper post and wider 30 mm rims shod with grippy, big volume 2.35in tyres.
The result is a bike that doesn't just look fast, but is capable of taking even the most demanding of trails apart and reassembling them in smooth, easily-digestible chunks of flat-out fun.
Carbon-framed efficiency, race course-bred speed and trail-capable components build into a machine that's far more than the sum of its parts.
Race to win, ride to live: it's the Cube Trail Motion creed.
It has to be built them to perform, too.
A frame doesn't only need to look great.
Like all of their bikes, the AMS 100 C:68 TM 29's frame has passed all Cube's stringent in-house laboratory testing - so you can be sure it's more than capable of the job for which it's designed.
Crafted from their premium C:68 carbon using their own Advanced Twin Mold Technology, the Cube engineering team has built a chassis that's as light and stiff as it is good-looking.
From the Boost 148 rear end to the tapered head tube, it's all designed to steer accurately and transfer your pedalling input seamlessly to the rear wheel, so you can concentrate on the thing that matters: riding as fast as possible.
Hidden bolts and internal cable routing - including Di2 compatability - complement the frame's svelte looks and deceptively low weight.
The ultimate high speed trail machine?
It could well be.
You know how it is.
The chassis sets the standard for low weight and exceptional stiffness, but Cube didn't stop there.
They specced Kashima-coated Fox components for trail-taming suspension performance, light and strong Newmen cockpit parts for steering precision and comfort, a Natural Fit saddle to save a little more weight... and Shimano's brand new XTR 1x12 transmission with 10-51 tooth cassette.
The only thing missing is you.
At Cube they have more than a decade and a half's experience making fast, light cross-country full suspension bikes.
Everything they've learnt during that time has gone into this frame.
From the Boost 148 rear end and tapered head tube - which contribute to the AMS 100's superlative pedalling efficiency and uncannily accurate steering - to the superlight C:68 carbon construction and Advanced Twin Mold technology, everything about this frame serves one purpose: to make it the fastest way to get from A to B cross-country.
Di2 compatibility means it's future-proof, internal cable routing keeps gear shifts clean even on the muddiest of race courses, and the stealth appearance is given a helping hand by hiding bolts and pivots away.
That's why Cube created the AMS 100 C:68 SLT 29 - to match your performance on the race course and get you another pedal revolution closer to the podium.
Simple: by starting with Cube's proven carbon four bar suspension chassis and selecting only the very best components.
Sram's light, slick and precise XX1 Eagle transmission transfers your power to the stiff, agile Newmen wheelset.
Sleek, featherweight Newmen cockpit components keep you on track.
And Kashima coated Fox suspension ensures that every race course undulation is ironed out.
If there's a faster, lighter, more efficient and more reliable cross-country race bike out there?
The AMS 100 frame's good looks are more than skin deep.
Cube's best C:68 carbon is finessed into the lightest, stiffest structure possible using Cube's own in-house Advanced Twin Mold manufacturing technique for the ultimate in high strength and durability.
A Boost 148 rear end translates every watt of pedal power into trail-eating forward progress, while the tapered head tube ensures that this is a race bike that'll go exactly where its rider points it.
Cube concealed pivots and bolts to help emphasise the sleek looks, added Di2 compatibility and then routed all the cables internally to ensure trouble-free gear shifts in any conditions.
This is the ultimate cross-country package.
The Stereo 120 Race has always been about class-leading trail performance and comfort.
This year, Cube went back to the drawing board to make it sleeker, better handling and more capable than ever before.

This capable trail all-rounder is simply inspiring, whether you're using it to show your riding buddies a rapidly disappearing view of your back, or racking up the miles in an endurance event.
Tapered Head Tube
The Kona Operator has always been a top-class downhill bike.
In all bike parks of the world you will meet loyal fans of the Kona Downhillbike.
After a longer test phase, the operator has now been consistently set to 29 inch wheels and the geometry adapted accordingly.
With a very short tail for a 29" downhill bike and extremely robust bearings, the Operator DL still proves to be a playful rocket in the bike park and feels at home on the steep and technical trails of the Pacific-Northwest region.
Integrated frame protectors to dampen impacts of the double bridge fork, chain impacts and stones thrown against the down tube guarantee that the operator's frame can withstand even hard downhill seasons without a hitch.
From the sleek, hydroformed frame to the carefully slected components, Cube sweated all the details to create a comfortable trail companion that'll inspire and entertain in equal measure.
The RockShox Sektor RL fork serves up 130mm of smooth, easily adjustable bump swallowing in tandem with the Manitou Radium Expert shock, which adds 120mm of rear wheel travel.
Wide Answer Duroc 30 rims shod with grippy Schwalbe Nobby Nic tyres keep the rear end driving forward and the front end pointed where you want it, no matter what the trail serves up.
And, of course, Cube selected a combination of Shimano's reliable and slick XT and SLX components to propel you forward and bring you safely to a stop.
There's even a dropper post, so you can ride those steep, rocky and rooty trails with complete confidence.
It all adds up to a finely balanced, easy to live with trail-taming companion, whether you're an ardent singletrack warrior, alpine explorer or multi-day endurance rider.
The Stereo 120 Race 29's clean, dynamic looks aren't there by accident.

This doesn't just save precious grammes, it also improves steering precision and pedalling efficiency.
And the whole lot is designed around Cube's Efficient Trail Control kinematics and the stable but fun handling of the new Agile Trail Geometry.
It's the complete trail-taming package for long days out in the mountains.
The combination of sure-footed handling, easy-rolling 29er wheels, low weight and reliable components translates into endless singletrack miles with maximum riding smiles.
A Fox 34 Rhythm fork and DPS EVOL shock work together to seamlessly dispatch whatever obstacle blocks your path, while the Fulcrum wheelset and Sram 1x12 Eagle drivetrain translate your pedal power into forward motion via the grippy, comfortable Schwalbe tyres.
CUBE is aware, of course, that power is nothing without control - which is why they selected Shimano's powerful XT hydraulic disc brakes with a four piston caliper up front.
Ride more, ride futher, ride in more comfort... with the Stereo 120 TM 29.
It's tough to improve on something that's already so good, but CUBE knew from redeveloping the other Stereo bikes that they could extract even more comfort, control and capability from the Stereo 120.
Building around the smooth-rolling performance of 29er wheels, CUBE's design team tweaked every aspect of the Stereo 120 TM 29's frame.
The triple butted, hydroformed tubes boast a sleek new silhouette, emphasised by a completely reworked rocker linkage with hidden pivots.
By shaving material from where it's not needed and adding it where it is, then testing the resulting design to its limits in their own in-house test lab, CUBE knows for certain that they've created a chassis that's exactly the right combination of light, strong and stiff.
Totally revised Agile Trail Geometry and Efficient Trail Control suspension kinematics work together to deliver an uncompromisingly smooth, intuitive and comfortable ride.
The only thing missing... is you.
By combining a brand new, lightweight and trail-orientated frame with fast-rolling 29er wheels and top drawer components, CUBE created an extraordinary comfortable, agile and capable off-road machine that'll handle anything you care to throw at it.
It is, in many ways, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
From the slick, sleek and reliable Shimano XT brakes and transmission to the Fox 34 Factory fork and DPS Evol shock - both with Kashima coatings for the ultimate in bump sensitivity - CUBE selected only the best parts to pair with their design team's latest masterpiece.
A CUBE dropper post for those tricky, technical descents and light, strong Newmen wheels to keep you rolling complete the setup.
Whether you like to ride multi-day adventures or just enjoy singletrack blasts on your home turf, the Stereo 120 SL 29 has got your back.
Which is more important - looks or performance?
If you were to ask the CUBE engineering team, they'd probably tell you that each is as important as the other.
The Stereo 120 SL 29's elegant appearance is certainly no accident.
It combines hydroformed, triple butted aluminium tubes with advanced Efficent Trail Control kinematics and completely revised Agile Trail Geometry to stunning effect.
From the way the seatstays flow seamlessly via the rocker linkage - complete with hidden pivots - into the top tube, to the torture-testing CUBE undertakes in their own lab to measure ultimate strength and stiffness, every millimetre of this frame has been finessed to extract the very best performance and looks.
Internally routed cables even include stealth dropper post routing.
But CUBE doesn't want you just to admire the looks - they want you to ride it.
Because they're confident that you won't want to stop...
What do you call a bike that's as rock-solid dependable descending an Alp, as it is agile and sure-footed picking a route up the climb the other side of the valley?
The Cube engineering team has the answer: the brand new Stereo 150 C:62 Race 29.
All of Cube's experience in building race-winning bikes for the EWS series was condensed into a bike that'll inspire you to do more.
The full C:62 carbon frame's reworked geometry, sleek looks and revised kinematics are mated with Fox's superb 36 fork and DPX2 shock.
Cube selected Shimano's legendary 2x11 XT transmission for its unmatched reliability and combined it with a Race Face Aeffect crank for a quick and easy switch to a 1x setup.
And, of course, there's a Cube dropper post to enable even the steepest of technical trails to be tackled with ease.
Ride more - ride the Stereo 150 C:62 Race 29.
It's harder than it looks to build a rock-swallowing bike that's also agile and nimble.
Luckily, Cube's crack team of designers is up to the task.
Starting with the fast-rolling ability of 29er wheels, they crafted a full carbon frame - made from their signature C:62 carbon - that ticks all the right boxes for a mountain-taming machine.
Careful tube profiling and Boost 148 rear spacing gives it the rigidity needed for accurate steering and rapid acceleration in any situation.
There are ISCC05 tabs for a chainguide, the cables are routed internally out of the way of mud and, grit and water, and shock sizing is metric with a trunnion mount.
Short chainstays and a steep seat angle mean agile handling and incredible flickability, while the 66 degree head angle is specifically designed to accommodate 160mm forks.
Just jump on and shred.
A lot has changed since CUBE built their first Stereo full suspension bike.
Brand new for 2019, the Stereo 150 C:62 SL 29 condenses everything CUBE knows about building light, fast and versatile bikes into a sleek, elegant and hard-hitting all-rounder for the enduro enthusiast.
With a svelte new chassis crafted from their proprietary C:62 carbon, they've created the ideal companion for long days out in the mountains.
The 160 mm RockShox Lyrik fork and Super Deluxe RC3 - with trunnion mount - work together seamlessly to keep the light, stiff and strong Newmen Evolution wheelset firmly glued to the trail.
Delivering power to the rear wheel is Sram's GX Eagle 12 speed groupset with an X1 carbon crank, but there's cable routing for a 2x setup too.
Sram Code R brakes help keep your speed in check, the CUBE dropper post opens up your line choices, and CUBE even specced an enduro-specific Race Face Turbine R handlebar.
Drop into the most technical of descents, rail flowy singletrack and pedal back to the top to rinse and repeat - it's all there for the taking.
How do you combine mountain goat agility with mountain lion speed?
A good start is to ask CUBE engineers to do the seemingly impossible and build a bike that climbs almost as well as it descends.
The result is the Stereo 150 29's elegantly sculpted C:62 carbon frame.
The clean lines, rocker cover and trunnion mount shock are designed to combine efficiency, stability and intuitive handling.
Boost 148 rear axle spacing works together with the tapered head tube and oversized down tube to deliver unparalleled steering precision and pedal input.
ISCG05 tabs for a chainguide are standard, while short chainstays ensure agile handling and, in combination with the 75,5 degree seat tube, provide efficient climbing.
The low standover and head tube specifically designed for a 160mm fork add the confidence, control and precision you need for sure-footed descending.
It's the master of them all.
There was a time when mountain-taming descending ability came with a side order of uphill sluggishness.
That time is firmly in the past.
Meet the brand new Stereo 150 C:68 TM 29 - an enduro bike that'll reset your expectations.
Built around a completely new frameset crafted from Cube's premium C:68 carbon, the CUBE design team has created an extraordinary race-capable all-rounder that's almost as adept propelling its rider skyward as it is cashing in gravity credits on the way back down.

Ride every trail, everywhere, faster and smoother with the Stereo 150 C:68 TM 29.
Given a blank sheet of paper and a seemingly impossible design brief, the CUBE design team came up with a winner.
A head angle designed around a 160mm fork gives solidly predictable handling, no matter whether you're spinning up a steep climb or barrelling down a mountainside.
Meanwhile, a 75,5 degree seat angle combined with short 435mm chainstays combine to give agile handling and efficient climbing, aided and abetted by the stiffness-enhancing Boost 148 rear axle.
There's internal cable routing for a 2x gear setup option, as well as built in ISCG05 tabs for a chain guide - so Cube covered all the transmission bases.
The whole lot is crafted from Cube's premium C:68 carbon, lovingly sculpted into flowing lines with super-clean looks, a rocker cover and trunnion shock mount.
More than just a pretty face, it's a frame that will rise to whatever challenge you throw at it.
The Action Team label isn't one that Cube hands out lightly.
Fresh out of their design lab for 2019, the Stereo 150 C:68 Action Team 29 is the ultimate go-anywhere, ride-anything enduro race machine - a race-winning replica with the finest parts available.
Surprisingly light, supremely nimble and utterly assured in any trail situation, CUBE has thrown everything at the range-topping Alp-devouring machine to make sure that it's the best of the EWS best.
Built around the new C:68 carbon Stereo 150 chassis with sleek lines and performance to match, Cube began with Fox's matchless 36 HSC fork and race-winning Float X2 Kashima shock.
They added DT Swiss wheels with wide, strong and stiff 30 mm rims, and specced a sticky Schwalbe Magic Mary tyre up front for the ultimate in braking and steering grip.
Shimano's brand new XTR 1x12 groupset covers a staggeringly wide gear range with a 10-51 tooth cassette, and has the braking power to match.
And, of course, Cube added a Fox Transfer Kashima dropper post, e*thirteen chainguide and Race Face carbon handlebar for maximum control, no matter how demanding the trail conditions.
The podium beckons.
Because the Stereo 150 Action Team 29 most definitely is.
Races don't win themselves, which is why so much research and development goes into all of Cube’s team bikes.
The Stereo 150 29's frame represents the culmination of all the experience Cube has gained on the EWS race circuit, channelled into a sleek, efficient and uncompromisingly fast C:68 carbon chassis.
Revised geometry combines a 66 degree head angle - designed to work perfectly with a 160 mm fork - with a 75.5 degree seat for efficient climbing.
Despite the fast-rolling 29er wheels, Cube’s engineering team managed to reduce the chainstay length to a lithe, agile 435 mm for inspiring on-demand handling in tight and twisty singletrack.
Internal cable routing is designed to work with any 1x or 2x transmission and there's a built-in ISCG05 chain guide tab.
Boost 148 rear wheel spacing works with the oversized down tube, tapered head tube and careful chassis design to deliver superbly precise steering and tracking.
And the whole lot is sleek, elegant and surprisingly easy on the eye.
Rest assured, it rides every bit as good as it looks.
Meet the Hanzz 190 Race:
Cube's affordable, capable and bomb-proof bike park playmate, slopestyle competitor and downhill racer.
With a short geometry specifically designed to maximise the fun factor, it's a robust chassis that'll take whatever you throw at it.
The single crown 180 mm Suntour Durolux RC fork and Fox Van RC shock work together to absorb the hits so that you can attack the trail hard and fast.
And, with a Shimano Deore 10 speed transmission, Magura MT5 brakes and Answer Atac Duroc 30 wheels, you can shred safely in the knowledge that these reliable components won't let you down.
Bring on the gnar, because the Hanzz 190 Race is ready.
At Cube they have many years of experience in building strong, durable aluminium frames - and they put all that know-how into the Hanzz 190 Race.
Starting with their High Performance Aluminium (HPA) tubes, Cube built them into a frame that's specifically designed to handle the harshest of riding conditions without flinching.
Mechanically formed tubes allowed their engineers to build in extra strength and rigidity where it's needed most, while a threaded bottom bracket and external cable routing keeps things simple and easy to maintain.
At the rear, the seat stays are designed for the 180 mm fork and run down to a 157 mm width thru axle.
As with all of their frames, it's passed Cube's stringent in-house torture testing with flying colours.
You can rely on the Hanzz 190 Race - it's got your back.
Whether you're pushing your limits in the bike park or lining up for the start of another downhill run, you need to know that you can rely on your bike.
Cube built the Hanzz 190 SL 27.5 to fulfil that role, without breaking the bank.
A nimble-handling, bomb-proof aluminium chassis is paired with RockShox's all-new dual crown, 200mm travel Boxxer RC fork for the ultimate in gravity-fuelled fun.
With a Fox VAN Performance shock out back, Sram's 10 speed GX transmission, Sram Code R brakes and Answer Atac Duroc wheels, you've got everything you need to push your riding further, steeper, faster and higher.
Hands down, your top choice for affordable gravity fun.
Cube built the Hanzz 190 SL to be strong enough to stand up to some serious riding, but nimble enough to be fun while you're shredding.
That's why they used all the experience they've gained from building strong, light and manouevrable aluminium frames, starting with the High Performance Aluminium (HPA) tubes and using your mechanical forming process to ensure that the frame has strength and ridigity exactly where it's needed most.
Cube backed up this design approach with rigourous lab testing to confirm that the Hanzz 190 SL is more than strong enough for the job.
A 157 mm thru axle at the rear and seat stays specially designed to handle the stresses handed out by a 200 mm dual crown fork are part of the package, while externally routed cables are simple to maintain.
Cube sweated the details, so you can concentrate on shredding.
Riding the gravity roller-coaster demands a special kind of bike.
The Hanzz 190 TM 27.5 blends affordability, fun and rock-solid durability into a total package that's ideal for everything from full days at the bike park to a first season on the downhill race circuit.
Combing a bomb-proof frame featuring a short, agile geometry with a selection of the best components Cube could find, they've created a bike that brings gravity riding within reach of any keen rider.
The Fox 36 Float Factory fork, Float X2 Factory shock, Shimano XT 1x11 speed transmission, Shimano XT four piston brakes and super-durable e*thirteen wheelset are everything you need to take your riding to the next level.
Strength, durability and fun - those are the characteristics Cube were looking for when they set out to design the Hanzz 190 TM's frame.
Starting with their High Performance Aluminium (HPA) tubes, Cube used their mechanical tube forming manufacturing process to ensure that extra strength and durability is built in where it's needed, as standard... and then they checked that they'd got theirr sums right with Cube's in-house torture testing lab.
You can rest assured, the Hanzz 190 TM is strong.
Very strong.
It's also nimble, thanks to a geometry that's designed to keep the fun factor high and the rider in full control, at all times.
Seat stays tailored to the 180 mm fork, a 157 mm thru axle and externally routed cables for easy maintenance are all part of the deal.
Just jump aboard and shred.
Downhill racing continues to evolve, and so does our Two15 Race downhiller.
Light, dynamic, affordable and a potent force on the downhill race circuit and in the bike park, our gravity bike's design builds on the success of its predecessors.
With a full 215mm of travel at the rear, the Two15 Race has plenty in reserve for tackling even the most demanding of downhill trails.
The Suntour RUX RC2 fork and Fox Van rear shock work together to provide the grip and control you'll need to tame any terrain at speed, while Sram's 10 speed GX components will help ensure you're always in the right gear to get the power down.
Magura MT5 brakes with a 200mm front rotor have all the stopping power you'll need, served up via a lightweight and tough Answer Atac Duroc wheelset shod with grippy Schwalbe Magic Mary tyres.
Full bore, full control and fully affordable: that's the Two15 Race.
The Two15 Race is designed to be fast-rolling, nimble and controllable.
With practically bottomless travel and the sharp handling and superb responsiveness you'd expect from a CUBE full suspension bike, it's all you need to chase down a podium place or hone your bike park technique.
We've even kept the looks clean and elegant, with internal cable routing that'll help ensure perfect shifting in even the filthiest of riding conditions.
Optimised chainstays equipped with a 12x157mm thru axle to provide accurate tracking and razor-sharp handling - and angles specially designed to keep you in control no matter how rowdy things get - are all part of the package.
Whether it's battling against the clock on a World Cup downhill course or having a blast in the bike park, the Two15 SL is up for it.
Despite its burly credentials, this is a bike that's designed to be both lighter than you'd expect and reassuringly bomb-proof - because lighter means easier to handle, which translates to more speed, and more speed is what it's all about... right?
Taking their usual no-compromise approach, our designers selected a premium crop of components to give the Two15 SL the competitive edge that it deserves.
A Race Face cockpit combines with Sram's GX DH 7 speed transmission and Magura MT7 hydraulic disc brakes to put you firmly in control.
Light, tough DT CSW DH 3.7/3.9 wheels wrapped in Schwalbe Magic Marys provide the motive force you'll need, while a Fox 40/49 Float Factory fork and matching Float X2 Factory shock keep the rubber side down, no matter how hard you shred.
Newly updated with a more progressive geometry for 2019 and additional sizes in 29", the principle behind the Two15's frame design is the same successful four pivot concept that powers all our full suspension bikes.
That's important, because it means that we were able to realise the same suspension characteristics as our super-efficient trail bikes, but with plenty of rear wheel travel and noticeably better agility and control than simpler DH bike designs.
But we didn't stop with the kinematics, because our engineers also put a lot of effort into reducing weight.
The Two15's hydroformed, triple butted tubeset with 157 mm rear hub spacing weighs only a bit more than an enduro frame, but delivers extraordinary steering precision and epic rock swallowing capability.
Are you ready to shred?
When the open road calls, you'll want a bike that blends comfort with easy handling and lively performance.

You don't need to suffer for your sport.
The tapered steerer and mechanically formed down tube provide a rigid backbone for efficient power delivery and accurate steering, while slender seatstays and a full carbon fork reduce road shock and vibration for significantly improved rider comfort, even on rough roads and long rides.
The Attain Race's Superlight 6061 aluminium chassis is no exception.
Double butted tubes reduce weight wherever possible whilst maintaining the strength for which all CUBE's frames are renowned - and which they prove every day in CUBE's in-house test lab.
Because Cube is all about speed... but comfort is important too.
Speed and comfort aren't mutually exclusive, but successfully blending them demands rigourous attention to detail.
The Attain Race Disc brings a little of the racing spirit to longer rides, post-work blasts with your training buddies, or regular training sessions - without sacrificing comfort or safe, predictable handling.
Thoroughbred details like the Tektro disc brakes, Shimano Tiagra 10 speed transmission and Superlight 6061 aluminium chassis combine with Cube's uniqe Road Comfort Geometry to deliver a fast, surprisingly comfortable and eminently capable mile-muncher.
Cube began with the precise steering and vibration-absorbing full carbon fork, to help filter out road vibrations and reduce hand fatigue.
Then they reduced the diameter of the seat stays, building in just enough vertical flex to increase rider comfort without sacrificing efficiency.
Cube's engineers wouldn't stand for that - they're obsessed with preserving every watt of pedal power and transferring it to the rear wheel.
That's why there's a mechanically formed, complex profile down tube anchored at one end by a PressFit bottom bracket shell and at the other by a tapered head tube.
Internal cable routing preserves the sleek frame's looks, keeps gear shifts cleaner for longer and reduces maintenance.
And, of course, they made sure there's enough room to run 28c tyres for greater comfort, more grip and better handling on any road surface.
The Attain GTC Pro has carved out a bit of a name for itself - as a great value endurance machine that's not just quick and efficient, but light and comfortable too.
Jump aboard this bike and you'll quickly realise why carbon has established itself as the discerning rider's frame material of choice.
Details like the shock-absorbing Flex Stays and stiff, strong down tube create a combination of inspiring speed and beguiling comfort.
Combined with equipment highlights like the new Mavic Aksium wheelset and slick-shifting, 2019 Shimano 105 transmission, this is the ideal race bike for demanding riders looking for a companion on long, fast rides.
Oh, the letters 'GTC'?
They stand for Gran Turismo Composite - a fitting name...
The Attain GTC Pro's frame was developed from the ground up by Cube's engineers to combine class-leading comfort, performance and low weight for endurance riding.
The beauty of carbon construction is that, with the right expertise, practically anything is possible.
So, for example, the rear end's slim aero Flex Stays are designed to reduce the impact of road shocks on the rider - a clear advantage on longer rides, increasing comfort and reducing the symptoms of fatigue and tension.
The big volume down tube, combined with the PressFit bottom bracket and tapered head tube, ensures that the rider's efforts are efficiently converted into forward propulsion, and that every steering impulse is precisely transmitted to the front wheel.
As you'd expect from Cube, they maintained the frame's elegant looks by routing cables internally, which also has the benefit of keeping gear shifts cleaner for longer.
We designed the Attain GTC Race so that it's as comfortable as it is fast - which means it's the ideal choice for endurance riding.
It's a bike made to break personal bests, whether that's on a long distance training route or a local hill climb.
To achieve this blend of pace and plushness we selected the best off-the-shelf technology available - including Shimano's Ultegra components, which borrow heavily from the range-topping Dura Ace groupset - and bolted it all to a cutting edge carbon frame.
Fulcrum Racing 77 wheels and sleek, light and strong CUBE finishing components complete a package that's pure-bred racing snake, built to take on anything from a sportive to an epic hilly ride with your training buddies.
The Attain GTC Race is built around the latest development of our carbon frame technology, complete with matching carbon fork plugged into an integrated headset.
We also equipped the frame with æro Flex Stays - an important feature that adds a dose of welcome comfort to this race-bred machine, without in any way detracting from its ability to devour the miles at speed.
Incredible stiffness is provided by the tapered head tube, joined in turn to the large cross-section down tube - which means assured, stable handling and instantaneous responses, even at high speed.
To ensure the best drivetrain efficiency we selected PressFit for the crucial bottom bracket bearings.
And, in keeping with the sleek Gran Turismo-inspired looks, we ran all the cables internally for longer-lasting clean shifts.
The Attain GTC SL Disc is a masterpiece of both aesthetics and function.
This high performance race bike combines the sublime comfort and superb acceleration of a high tech carbon frame with the safety of the latest disc brake technology - the ultimate high speed endurance machine.
Shimano's peerless Ultegra gears, compact and elegant brand new Shimano 105 disc brakes and a Fulcrum Racing 66 wheelset blend with the taut, elegant but surprisingly comfortable carbon frame to make a genuine long-distance mile-muncher.
Efficiency, comfort and performance: it's all in the Attain GTC SL Disc's genes.
As part of the process Cube chose a 12 mm axle system both front and rear to improve rigidity.
Optimising a frame for disc brakes is both art and science.
The forces involved also necessitate a specially designed fork which, together with the Attain GTC SL Disc's tapered head tube, creates an enormously stiff and precise structure.
But Cube hasn't forgotten comfort, which is just as important for sustained performance.
The fork's carbon blades work together with slender Flex Stays at the rear to help filter out energy-sapping road shock, reducing fatigue even on long rides and bad road surfaces.
This way, the rider benefits from a smooth ride, accurate steering and incredible efficiency... all rolled into one.
Internally routed cables match the frame's Gran Turismo-inspired sleek looks, as well as minimising maintenance.
Full length mudguards are an easy addition, if the need arises - an option that Cube built in because even hardened racers like to stay dry on long training rides in poor weather.
When Cube sat down to design the Agree C:62 Pro, they had one goal in mind: to set a new benchmark in the endurance race bike category.
Riding long and hard on a bike that responds to your every whim - but without beating you up - is what it's all about.
High tech carbon frame construction, incredible attention to detail and Cube's fastidious in-house testing mean you can be assured of an exceptional ride.
But this level of performance needn't break the bank.
With Shimano's Ultegra components for slick shifting and powerful braking, a light and strong Mavic wheelset and a frame that's both incredibly stiff and surprisingly comfortable, pro level performance is now within any rider's reach.
The high tech carbon chassis at the heart of the Agree C:62 Pro represents the current state of the art in carbon fibre frame construction.
As you'd expect from a race bike of this calibre, all the cables are routed internally for clean looks and long service life.
In addition to the tapered head tube - which houses the comfortable, accurate and aerodynamic carbon fork - Cube has also equipped the C:62 Pro with an integrated seat clamp.
It's just one of the small touches that adds to its efficiency in cutting through the wind.
But aerodynamics don't count for much without power, which is why Cube has finessed the chain and seatstay design to provide an exceptional combination of pedalling efficiency with ride-all-day comfort.
Add the PressFit bottom bracket and Di2 compatability and you'll see that, whatever your race ambitions, Cube has got your back.
Turn up to a race or a training ride with the Agree C:62 Race Disc and it's fair to say that you've run out of excuses... but you've also got a thoroughbred racing machine on your side.
With a full Newmen cockpit setup, Shimano's extraordinary Ultegra gears and hydraulic disc brakes and a light, stiff and strong Newmen Evolution SL R.32 wheelset, this is an endurance machine that will bring out the best in every rider.
Whether it's tough climbs - where its low weight and exceptional drivetrain efficiency come to the fore - or long, fast descents - where the fade-free power of the hydraulic disc brakes and agile geometry work together to ensure you're always in full control - you're onto a winner.
And all served up with the comfort you need to reduce fatigue, mile after mile.
This cutting edge carbon frame is equipped to perform.
All that's missing is you.
You know the saying: power is nothing without control.
When Cube set out to design the chassis for the Agree C:62 Race Disc, they knew they had to achieve both exceptional drivetrain efficiency and unsurpassed comfort.
Mutually incompatible goals?
Not for Cube's engineers.
A tapered head tube, oversized down tube and PressFit bottom bracket shell work with 12 mm axles to delivery razor-sharp handling and incredible drivetrain efficiency, with strength to spare to handle the extra loads from hydraulic disc brakes.
Meanwhile, slender stays and carbon fork blades are specially designed to help reduce rider fatigue on even the roughest road surfaces.
Internally routed cables, Di2 compatability and an integrated seat clamp add the finishing touches that emphasise this bike's thoroughbred potential.
With the Litening C:62 Pro Cube had a very simple goal: to develop an affordable, state-of-the-art race bike capable of taking the fight - and you - to the head of the peloton.
The combination of a C:62 carbon frame with matching CSL C:62 carbon fork is just the start.
Cube added Newmen cockpit components, Shimano's Ultegra gears and brakes and a Mavic Ksyrium wheelset to give you the edge that you need.
Whether you're tackling a club race, long sportive or a tough training ride, this is a bike that'll keep your competition on its toes and your personal goals in sight.
The only missing component is you.
The Litening C:62 Pro's elegant, lightweight chassis is pure, unadulterated carbon perfection.
The use of Cube's Advanced Twin Mold technique, monocoque construction and superior carbon fibre gives Cube maximum control over the fibre lay-up - and that enables them to build a frame that's as light as it is stiff.
Oversized carbon tubes in the main frame and chainstays, a tapered head tube and super stiff bottom bracket area all ensure an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio for the best possible power transfer.
Slim seat stays and a flattened top tube are designed to introduce a degree of controlled flex, adding comfort to the ride experience without sacrificing performance.
Go hard, go long, go fast: it's what this bike is all about.
What do you get when you combine the proven performance advantages of a state-of-the-art carbon race bike with the awesome stopping power of disc brakes?
The short answer is the Litening C:62 Race Disc.
The longer answer would have to take into account the full C:62 carbon chassis and matching fork, the peerless shifting performance of Shimano's Ultegra Di2 electronic gears, and the speed advantage offered by disc brakes.
Brake later, brake harder and brake confidently, even in the wet: those are the Litening C:62 Race Disc's unbeatable characteristics.
With Newmen cockpit components and a Newmen Evolution SL R.25 wheelset, this bike has everything you need to take your performance all the way to the podium.
Disc brakes demand special consideration when it comes to frame design.
So Cube took their Advanced Twin Mold, monocoque construction frame and aero CSL C:68 fork and optimised both for the extra power of disc brakes.
Oversized carbon tubes in the main frame and chainstays, a tapered head tube and super stiff bottom bracket area all ensure an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio, so you can make the best use of your power and strength.
But it's not all about speed over comfort - slim seat stays and a flattened top tube add controlled flex to reduce rider fatigue over longer distances.
Power, control and comfort: you CAN have it all.
The Litening C:68 SL is so fast - even on the climbs - that it'll make your eyes water.
No word of a lie.
This ultralight and super stiff race machine will appeal to speed freaks, adarenaline junkies and died-in-the-wool racers alike.
As near as they can get to a pro level race machine, Cube's design team cut no corners in their quest to maximise performance.
The frame comes perilously close to breaking the magic 850 gramme barrier, while Cube's choice of the finest components - including Shimano's superb Dura Ace groupset, a tubeless-ready Mavic Ksyrium Elite wheelset and Newmen carbon cockpit components - means there's practically no room for future upgrades.
Which means the only thing left for you to do... is to ride.
At Cube they understand that there's no room for compromise if you want to be the best.
For the Litening C:68 SL frame they set out to achieve exceptionally low weight with the latest C:68 carbon technology, optimised frame tube shapes and their Advanced Twin Mould production process.
But Cube didn't stop there, because they also wanted to improve both comfort and efficiency.
The stretched geometry creates an incredibly efficient riding position for rapid forward progress, but keeps the handling agile.
And Cube's Litening C:68 fork combines the best possible comfort with incredible steering precision and very low weight.
Want to test your own limits and leave the competition behind?
The no-compromise Aerium C:68 SL is the perfect tool for the job.
Developed in conjunction with the aerodynamics and Formula One specialists at SwissSide, this no-holds-barred speed machine leaves UCI regulations behind in the quest for ultimate performance.
Wind tunnel testing, real world data-logging and fastidious attention to detail make this the fastest triathlon machine out there according to Cube's testing.
There's even a dedicated food storage and hydration system included in the price, so you can refuel on the move without breaking from your aero tuck.
Equipped with Shimano's new Ultegra Di2 components and Magura hydraulic rim brakes, you've everything you need to set new personal records - and get your competition really worried.
There's more to developing a wind-cheating bike than giving it lots of 'aero' shaped tubes.
That's why Cube worked with the development team at Formula One specialists SwissSide, whose experience in reducing drag proved invaluable in building a new standard in triathlon bikes.
Wind tunnel testing helped Cube to reduce the effects of crosswinds and turbulence, giving the Aerium C:68 SL not just incredible straight line speed but impressive stability out in real world riding conditions, too.
Low seatstays help to reduce the frontal area, while the unique slotted head tube acts as a spoiler.
The hydraulic brake system, developed in conjunction with Magura, is designed for quick wheel changing and easy adjustment - and, of course, all cables and hoses are hidden away, out of the wind.
Cube even included food storage and drinking systems into the frame, both of which are accessible without moving from the aero riding position.
Cube know from their testing that this is the best triathlon bike out there.

After a longer test phase, the operator has now been consistently set to 27.5 inch wheels and the geometry adapted accordingly.
With a very short tail for a 27.5" downhill bike and extremely robust bearings, the operator still proves to be a playful rocket in the bike park and feels at home on the steep and technical trails of the Pacific Northwest region.
The 27.5" aluminum version of the Kona Operator with RockShox Super Deluxe Coil R Trunnion damper and RockShox Boxxer RC fork relies on 200mm butter soft steel spring lift and is equipped with SRAM Guide T brake system, SRAM X9 drive, Raceface, FSA and Kona parts for the toughest tracks of your next bike park road trip.
12 x 157 mm rear wheel axle
12 x 142 mm, 12 x 148 and 12 x 157 rear axle standards offer two main advantages for Kona riders: the 12 mm diameter of the rear axle ensures maximum stability on the rear hub and frame, while the 142/148/157 mm outer diameter of the hub ensures that the wheel is fast and correctly positioned in the frame before the rear axle can be used.
From 2016, the 12 x 148 standard will be available as a mix, especially on the new Operator series.
The 29" aluminum version of the Kona Operator with RockShox Super Deluxe Coil RC damper and RockShox Boxxer WC fork relies on 190mm butter soft steel spring lift and is equipped with SRAM Code R brake system, SRAM GX 7x drive, FSA and Kona parts for the toughest tracks of your next bike park road trip.
The Kona Process Bike-Line has caused enthusiasm among testers of the trade press, bike professionals and hobby pilots alike.
At a time when trail and enduro bikes are increasingly made of carbon, Kona's aluminium process convinces with its inner values.
The very stiff frames with a comparatively simple rear end and the strongly sloping top tube do not only claim to have a modern and aggressive geometry.
They anticipated the development.
With very long top tube and wheelbase, really short rear and flat steering angle, they feature impressive handling in all suspension travel variants and seem to blossom out the more the trail gets down to business.
The Kona Process 153 stands on wide 27.5 inch wheels, has a moderate 153 mm travel at the rear and a 160 mm Rock Shox Yari at the front.
But you shouldn't be deceived by the travel of a typical All Mountain Fullys in this country with the Process 153.
The progressive bike shows the character of an enduro race bike, rewards aggressive and powerful riding with razor-sharp handling and seems to become faster and faster.
On the way to the next trail entry, the seating position and rear triangle prove to be quite efficient.
Like all Process models, the Process 153 is limited to the gorge-less operation, relies on the 1x11 Sram NX drive, but already gets the widely graded 11-42 cassette.
The Sram Guide T disc stoppers will slow you down again when you and the Process go through the motions.
For Kona, an adjustable saddle support is standard equipment on such a potent bike.
Maxxis tyres, WTB and Kona parts complete the bike in a professional way.
An internal headset also reduces the height of the body, making it easier to adjust the height of the stem and handlebars to provide the best fit for the driver.
Much of the 7005/6061 tubing is butted and/or shaped, meaning that the wall thickness of the tubing can be both increased and decreased and shaped, allowing Kona to fine-tune a specific frame to customize strength and riding characteristics for each application.
At a time when trail and enduro bikes are more and more often made of carbon, Kona convinces with its aluminium process through inner values.
Like all Process models, the Process 153 is limited to the gorge-less operation, relies on the 1x12 Sram GX drive, but already gets the widely graded 11-50 cassette.
The Sram Guide R disc stoppers will slow you down again when you and the Process go through the motions.
Maxxis tires, WTB and Kona parts complete the bike in a professional way.
TUBELESS COMPATIBLE RIMS
Tubeless rims enable tires with greater puncture resistance; the ability to drive at lower tire pressure for better tire grip on the track; lower rolling resistance; and weight savings over conventional tube and tire systems.
12x142mm, 12x148 and 12x157 rear axle standards offer the Kona driver two major advantages:
The Kona Process 153 stands on wide 27.5 inch wheels, has a moderate 153 mm travel at the rear and a 160 mm RockShox Lyrik RC at the front.
But you shouldn't be deceived by the suspension travel of a typical All Mountain Fullys in this country with the Process 153.
The progressive bike shows the character of an enduro race bike, rewards aggressive and powerful riding with razor-sharp handling and only seems to get faster and faster.
Maxxis tires, WTB and Kona parts complete the bike according to its status.
KONA Carbon
In order to continuously improve the growing fleet of Kona Carbon bicycles, the Kona design team works closely with the manufacturers.
To ensure the desired riding characteristics, the stability and weight requirements are met at the highest level.
Kona Carbon bikes are lightweight, super fast, extremely durable and wildly fun.
An internal headset also reduces the body height, making it easier to adjust the stem and handlebar height for the best fit for the driver.
The Kona Process 153 stands on wide 29 inch wheels, has a moderate 153 mm travel at the rear and a 160 mm Rock Shox Yari at the front.
An internal headset also reduces the body height, making the stem and handlebar height more adjustable, allowing the rider to make the best adjustment.
The Kona Process 153 stands on wide 29 inch wheels, has a moderate 153 mm travel at the rear and a 160 mm Rock Shox Lyrik RC at the front.
Like all Process models, the Process 153 is limited to the gorge-less operation, relies on the 1x12 Sram GX Eagle drive, but already gets the wide graded 10-50 cassette.
The Kona Process 134 uses 27.5 wheels and offers 134 mm rear travel in combination with a 140 mm Rock Shox sector at the front.
Moderate values on paper and also in practice crisp enough to make single trail junkies uphill fun.
Once you have arrived at the start of the downhill, just click on the remote lever of the lowerable support and take a deep breath to allow bikes with considerably more suspension travel to return to a cloud of dust.
The long, flat and deep geometry of the Process 134 and the efficient rear end reward an aggressive riding style and convey a real enduro bike feeling on the descent.
Like all Process models limited to the front derailleur-less drive, the Process 134 relies on a 1x10 Shimano drive and the proven Shimano Disc-Stopper.
With Race Face cranks, Maxxis tyres, WTB and Kona parts, the Process 134 is ready for action-packed trail rides right from the start.
Rocker Independent Suspension
Different riders have different needs, but trail and enduro riders need a lot of everything - both the best downhill performance and efficient climbing power.
12 x 142 mm rear axle
A consistent lever set curve that absorbs perfectly occurring loads and a stable pedal platform gives the rider a predictable feel throughout the ride.
The Process 153 SE offers you impressive performance at an affordable price.
This incredibly powerful 27.5" all mountain feels at home anywhere between flow trails and technical downhill tracks.
Designed, tested and optimized in Northwest America, without any rules or habits, this is a trail bike that only Kona can build.
27.5" wheel
The advantages of the 27.5 inch wheel are simple: they roll over obstacles better than 26 inch wheels, but are more agile than 29 inch wheels.
The Kona Konzo DL 27.5 combines 100% Trailbike riding feel with the lively character of a modern hardtail and the impressive traction of 2.8 inch plus tyres.
Kona sees its Honzo Hardtails even without Plus tyres as a real alternative to short-stroke Trailfully.
With a flat steering angle, short rear and long front, it follows the same philosophy as the fullys of the Process-series and shows that there is still a lot of future in the unsprung rear end if all the stops of modern bike technology are applied.
A steep seat angle ensures full propulsion uphill.
The standard remote seat post makes the Honzo DL a potent downhill partner.
The 130 mm suspension travel of the rigid Rock Shox Revelation and the wide Plus tyres give you self-confidence when the trail becomes steep and technical.
With this Hardtail you show your Fully friends also downhill the rear wheel.
Uphill anyway, thanks to the direct power transmission and the SRAM NX 1x11 drive.
The Plus version of the Kona Honzo DL is an ideal companion for demanding terrain and all imaginable backcountry adventures.
27.5 Plus wheels
The advantages of the 27.5-inch wheel are simple: they roll over obstacles better than 26-inch wheels, but are more agile and agile than 29-inch wheels.
They combine the best of both worlds, increasing overall performance and driving satisfaction.
From 2016, the 12 x 148 mm standard will be available as a mix, especially on the new Honzo alloy.
The Honzo was the first deep, trail-capable hardtail.
Its progressive geometry would be revised over the years, but its playful attitude hasn't changed a bit.
It's the 29 that doesn't feel like a 29, the reliable friend who's always ready to party and goes through thick and thin with you.
With a RockShox Recon 120mm suspension fork, Sram NX crank, Sram NX 11-speed drive with wide transmission range, Vario seatpost with internal cable routing and WTB Trail Boss tyres, Kona Honzo is ready to celebrate.
12 x 142 mm, 12 x 148 mm and 12 x 157 mm rear axle standards offer two main advantages for Kona riders: the 12 mm diameter of the rear axle ensures maximum stability on the rear hub and frame, while the 142/148/157 mm outer diameter of the hub ensures that the wheel is fast and correctly positioned in the frame before the rear axle can be used.
From 2016, the 12x148 mm standard will be available as a mix, especially on the new alloy Honzo.
12x148 offers more tyre clearance on the chain stay, while the rear wheel is more stable and durable compared to a 12 x 142 mm thru axle.
Much of our 7005/6061 tube is tapered and / or shaped, which means that the wall thickness of the tube can be both increased or decreased and shaped so that we can fine-tune the strength and ride characteristics of a particular frame depending on the intended application.
The Kona Sutra is a classic touring bike with all the features you need for your dream tour.
The Shimano Deore gearshift is complemented with TRP Spyre C disc brakes and Schwalbe Marathon Mondial tyres.

The Dew Deluxe's stylish aluminium frame and lightweight fork can easily handle any road surface.
Smooth gear changes are provided by the Shimano gearshift, while the hydraulic brakes deliver reliable braking power in every situation and under all conditions.

650b BRAKEWHEELS
Cleaned up, stylish and always ready, the Dr. Dew presents itself as a luxurious model of the Kona series.
The offensive orange frame set conveys the right mixture of sporty agility and, driving comfort and easy handling.
Mudguards and bell are already standard on the Dr. Dew.
Nothing stands in the way of an optional luggage carrier month.
The 1x11 Sram Apex gear system with large cassette offers the same large transmission range as gear systems with several chainrings, but is much more intuitive in operation.
Hydraulic disc brakes ensure weather-independent acceleration with minimal hand forces all year round.
Where the road does not offer ideal conditions, the lightly rolling tyres provide a noticeable plus in comfort.
650b wheels
650b wheels and tyres have an overall diameter similar to a conventional 700c gravel or commuter tyre, but with a smaller diameter rim and a wider, larger tyre.
It's the best of both worlds.
Bearing shells are actually pushed into the frame and are easily removable.

Mondraker Chrono Carbon has everything that a full on XC race bike needs but works as good for your everyday training on your backyard trails.
The modern and aggressive geometry is the same as on Mondrakers top of the line XC-bike The Podium, it has a long reach that increases safety and confidence during high speed and downhills.
It comes in alu-models and carbon-models, the carbon-frame is one of the lightest on the market, 1150g.
They have full internal cable routing witch just adds to the good looking and high performing bike.
Mondraker's Podium is unique, but not only unique it's fast too!
Mondraker has always been innovative and this bike is not an exception with the exklusive aesthetics that combines ground breaking features with an outstanding design concept.
This is the first pick for the whole Mondraker UCI Elite team.
For 2019 the Podium features high performance components with SRAM drivetrain and the frame features the highest standard Stealth AIR Carbon technology and IST EVO - Integrated Stem Technology.
IST EVO - Integrated Stem Technology
Mondraker’s proprietary Integrated Stem Technology introduces a more integrated, lighter and more compact aero-style design for 2017.
Made from Stealth Carbon fibre with a lightweight of just 128 grams complete, IST-EVO delivers greater rigidity and steering precision superior to those of traditional design.
Available in 4 sizes, 75 mm, 90 mm, 105 mm and optional 115 mm, new IST-EVO offers an optimum pedalling position, perfect integration and maximum performance.
Stealth Air Carbon
Cutting-edge industrial design, aero-style profile, maximum stiffness / lightest weight / superior compliance ratio are common features of Stealth Air.
The FlatStays design filters the extra riding vibrations for a second-to-none riding comfort on a pure Carbon hardtail frame.
Lightweight is also key with a total 920 grams for the complete Podium Carbon frameset in size Medium which is 16% stiffer, 24% lighter and 25% more compliant compared to the previous model.
Mondraker's Foxy has revolutionized the MTB world with the innovative Forward Geometry.
150 mm travel in the back with Mondraker's own Zero Suspension kinematics reacts on all the small bumps and makes the ride smooth.
Available in either 27.5″ or 29″ wheel size, both frames feature a new alloy monoblock upper link, an integrated fender to protect the rear shock and over sized bearings and pivot axles ensuring further strength and durability.
The Mondraker Foxy Carbon R has revolutionized the MTB world with its innovative forward geometry.
The long top tube and short stem make the bike stable and easy to handle in steep and technical terrain, yet remains a great climber.
The new Foxy Carbon combines the best and most advanced technologies and is the greatest development a model has ever undergone in its technical features.
The design represents an exceptional breakthrough:
The front triangle has a more stylized layout with thinner tubes; the top tube is flatter in profile for more speed and less wear.
weight, while at the same time improving stiffness.
Finally, the rear section has been completely renewed and equipped with a structurally reinforced swingarm.
It is the first model to be offered by Mondraker in both Stealth Carbon and Stealth Air Carbon, the latter being the state-of-the-art and exclusive RR SL version.
The zero suspension system has been fully optimized so that the newly conceived rear suspension now offers superior performance.
It is the first model with Metric damper and Trunnion mount, and probably the model where Mondraker's developers spent most of their time developing and testing prototypes with different kinematic configurations until they finally had the best performance.
The more compact rear suspension is equipped with new 15mm swinging thru axles and larger bearings.
Thanks to its new kinematics, structural and technological upgrades and 150mm of increased travel, the damping has improved exponentially without becoming more spongy at the start.
This makes the new Foxy even more versatile and powerful, with exceptional rear suspension and a unique Foxy Carbon experience.
In addition, Mondraker's guys have developed the Forward Geometry so that the Foxy Carbon remains the flagship model.
They have concentrated on maintaining a balanced geometry and now offer the possibility to adjust the steering angle by 1° and the chain stay length by 10 mm - both functions have been taken directly from the Summum Carbon and Dune Carbon.
The Forward Geometry is based on the same geometry standard used on longer tubes with shorter stems (30mm) as the 2013 concept.
Having optimised this season for season, it now features minor improvements and enhancements that set Mondraker apart from the rest.
Zero Suspension System
The Zero Suspension System is a dual-link design in which the damper floats between the two suspensions and is compressed from both sides.
The main advantages of Zero Suspension technology are zero power loss - an absolutely stable ride while pedaling, zero pedal rebound, minimal chain impact, isolated braking and damping forces and what Mondraker call Zero Bumps its great ability to absorb any kind of shock, allowing the rear wheel to efficiently maintain the necessary grip on the ground.
The main advantages of forward geometry are increased safety and self-confidence on steep descents even at high speeds, more responsive, precise and direct handling, more precision and more stability in technical and rough terrain with better grip and improved overall control.
The front triangle has a more stylized layout with thinner tubes; the top tube is flatter in profile for more speed and less wear. weight, while at the same time improving stiffness.
Zero is a dual link design with the shock floating between the two suspension links and compressed from both ends.
Zero superior technologies’ main advantages are Zero power loss -a completely stable ride when pedalling-, Zero pedal kickback-minimum chain growth throughout the suspension travel-, Zero brake jack –isolated braking and suspension forces- and what we call Zero bumps, its great ability to soak up any type of bump keeping the rear wheel efficiently planted on the ground.
Stealth Carbon's constantly evolving technology brings all the experience of aluminium frame manufacturing to the top of the carbon fibre range to meet the same innovation, maximum quality, minimum weight and strength requirements.
The placement of the carbon fibre layers is an important technique with specific positioning and direction of the different quality fibres for each type of bike and each model.

You've put the miles in over the winter, honed your training to perfection and marked off all the race weekends in the calendar.
Now all you need is a bike that's up to the task - and that's where the AMS 100 C:68 SL 29 comes in. It's designed to perform in the toughest of race conditions, so that you can realise your true potential.
Proving that you should never judge a book by its cover, the Stereo 120 SL 29's understated looks disguise its prodigious trail-taming abilities.
To the uninitiated, cyclocross can seem an odd way to spend a weekend.
But we reckon the fast-paced racing, technical challenges and mixture of riding and running are a great, fun way to maintain fitness through the off season.
That's why Cube developed the Cross Race - a bike that blends race-bred handling with comfort and agility.
Low-maintenance Tektro Spyre disc brakes offer reliable, all-weather power through the worst that the winter can throw at you, while Shimano's new 105 gears, grippy Schwalbe tyres and a vibration-absorbing carbon fork complete the package.
Add it all up and it makes for a great value cyclocross bike, covering all the bases from entry-level racing to winter training.
Or, come to think of it, just sprinting off the lights when they turn green on your daily commute.
A bike, indeed, for all reasons.
Cube's design team loves sweating the details.
It's the reason you'll find thoughtful touches on the Cross Race, like the specially shaped, ergonomic top tube to make for easier carrying.
Double butted Superlite Advanced 6061 aluminium tubes, optimised via elaborate mechanical form, build into a structure that's both light and stiff.
Combined with 12 mm thru axles front and rear, it means you can be sure that the Cross Race will respond instantly to your every input.
Moreover, there's a focus on comfort - slender seat stays and a precise-steering, comfortable carbon fork developed specially for cyclocross work together to reduce rider fatigue.
Race-ready geometry provides a balanced ride position, ensuring handling that's the perfect blend of agile and stable.
The competition had better be ready for this.
Cube’s high-end cyclocross race machine is as subtly understated as it is uncompromisingly rapid - truly, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
They’ve thrown all their aluminium frame building expertise at the Cross Race SL, added a cyclocross-specific carbon fork and powerful Shimano Ultegra hydraulic disc brakes, then added Shimano's super-reliable 2x11 Ultegra transmission for clean, precise shifts, race after race.
To all of which only one thing can be added: with a bike this good, it's a shame the 'cross season is so short.
The Cross Race SL's double butted Superlite Advanced 6061 aluminium frame is totally geared for performance, so you can ride at your best.
Cube’s advanced mechanical forming process meant that their engineers were able to manipulate tube shapes to create the ideal blend of stiffness and comfort, as well as adding an ergonomically shaped top tube for more comfortable carrying.
They added 12mm thru axles to ensure maximum steering precision in even the toughest of riding conditions, but Cube also remembered that riders need comfort too - even on race day.
So they incorporated slender seat stays and a vibration-absorbing carbon fork, too.
Mud-proof internal cable routing will keep your shifting clean and precise, race after race - just one of the little details that will help ensure the best performance, off-road or on.
Here comes the Cross Race C:62 Pro - a sleek, carbon-framed race bike designed to excel in the muddy hell of competitive cyclocross.
Beginning with a chassis crafted from premium C:62 carbon, Cube added their full carbon cross-specific fork, Mavic's new Aksium Allroad Disc wheelset shod with Schwalbe's X-One Kevlar tyres, and Shimano's new Ultegra groupset complete with hydraulic disc brakes.
It's all designed to help you cut through both the mud and the competition.
Don't get cross.
Get the Cross Race C:62 Pro instead.
Cube's engineers love working with carbon for its low weight, high strength and incredible versatility.
For the Cross Race C:62 Pro frame, they applied some lateral thinking.
Racers love internal cable routing, because it keeps gear shifts reliably slick in even the filthiest of conditions.
But what if the cables were routed directly into the head tube?
The result is a super-clean look, no cable rub on the frame and even lower weight, because the down tube doesn't need to be reinforced to accept cable holes.
Win, win, win.
Changeable inserts allow a future upgrade to electronic shifting, and Cube offers five frame sizes so you can be assured of the perfect fit.
And of course, the whole lot is made from C:62 carbon for the best combination of low weight and high performance.
You'll know when cyclocross has really got to you, because you won't be able to wait for the weekend to come around again.
The Cross Race C:62 SLT was developed for cyclocross afficionados with mud running through their veins.
Ultralight, perfectly formed and equipped with one goal in mind: to win.
The C:62 carbon frameset and carbon fork is paired with the very best of everything, to give you that winning edge.
From the Newmen carbon cockpit and carbon wheelset to Shimano's Ultegra Di2 transmission and hydraulic disc brakes, Cube gave their designers free rein to indulge their perfectionist streak... so that you can indulge your winning streak.
Light, lighter, lightest.
Cube thought that choosing their premium C:62 carbon was a good start, but the Cross Race C:62 SLT needed something special to set it apart.
The answer came from an unusual direction:
Their engineering team decided to route cables internally via the head tube, rather than the usual down tube routing.
This approach fulfilled two goals.
First, it created an incredibly clean look and eliminated any cable rub.
And second, it meant Cube didn't need to reinforce the down tube to the same extent as usual, saving even more weight.
The Di2 cabling uses custom inserts which can be swapped out easily, should you decide to revert to mechanical cables.
Combined with the full carbon fork and race-bred geometry designed for quick, precise handling, the Cross Race C:62 SLT is proof that the devil really is in the detail.
Lightweight 27.5” wheels accelerate quickly and t most riders better, leading to a snappy and fun bike

The main compartment has a security pocket with a key clip as well as a pocket for a water bladder (not included) with an opening for drinking tube.
The zippered opening is asymmetric; it goes down further on one side making it easy to reach the contents of the main compartment when the backpack is still over one shoulder.
Zippered front pocket and inside pocket for stowing small items, and there is also a side pocket for a drinking bottle or the like.
This pack also includes a chest strap with whistle and a simple hip belt that can be detached when not needed.
Kånken was released in 1978 to help prevent back problems seen among Swedish school children.
Now over 35 years later Kånken has straightened out millions of backs and become one of Fjällräven’s most popular products, loved by generations of users.
Just like its predecessor, it is a durable everyday backpack, just as practical to use on the way to school or work as when on an outing or out travelling.
The main compartment has a generous opening that makes it easy to pack and take things out.
The back pocket has a padded sitting pad in G-1000 HeavyDuty so a comfortable rest is never far away.

G-1000 HeavyDuty Eco
G-1000 is rugged, but G-1000 Heavy Duty goes one step further.
It is impregnated on both sides with Greenland Wax and is therefore more durable than ever before.
Because it is less breathable than the original G-1000, however, Fjällräven uses it for products where durability is more important than air permeability.
For example as reinforcement material in places which are particularly stressed, and for many of their bags and backpacks.
Impregnation can be easily enhanced with Greenland Wax, something that also further increases durability.
If you want it to feel soft, they use G-1000 Heavy Duty Eco S. This mix of recycled polyester and cotton is slightly lighter than the regular version thanks to a finer weave.
Versatile backpack for active hunting and outdoor life that requires a lot of freedom of movement.
Its slim profile has an excellent fit and reduces the risk of the pack fastening on branches and undergrowth.
The innovative back plate is made from pressed discarded wool; a functional and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based synthetic materials.
The High Coast Kids backpack has been designed together with Swedish outdoor schools and has a number of practical features for school and play.
It has reflective details on all sides and the front pocket can be used for separate storage of wet clothing, keeping the rest of contents dry.
In addition, it is comfortable to carry with padded shoulder straps and a hipbelt to distribute weight comfortably.

Bergshell
Fjällräven's award-winning Bergshell material is waterproof enough for most situations - and the recycled material makes green hearts beat faster.
Bergshell is a completely new fabric from Fjällräven which is extremely durable and completely waterproof (10 000mm white TPU laminate).
At the same time, of course, it holds the high environmental standards that Fjällräven has, with 31% recycled nylon (from post-production) and a yarn process that halves the CO2 footprint.
Creating a material with the highest possible abrasion resistance and also the highest possible tear strength in 100 % nylon is not easy because it requires two completely different types of yarns.
In Bergshell Fjällräven combine filament yarn and air textured yarn creating a fabric that has both high abrasion strength and high tear strength.
Fjällräven's waterproof Bergshell material and taped seams make the Ulvö Rolltop a safe choice, even in unexpected showers and wet conditions.
The rolltop closure prevents water from entering and the padded compartment provides secure storage for a laptop.
A versatile and practical model for easy hikes, travel and everyday adventures.
A bicycle lamp can also be attached to a small loop and the logo is reflective.
Kånken Art is what you get when you invite artists to express their relationship with nature using a Kånken backpack as their canvas.
This year, we’re proud to introduce Erik Olovsson and Cecilia Heikkilä, two fantastic young creatives, both with their own unique form of expression.
Erik’s Summer/Spring Landscape and Cecilia’s Blue/Green Fable are beautiful new members of the Kånken Family.
These special edition Kånkens are also part of the Arctic Fox Initiative.
Nature doesn’t judge – and with the rainbow being a symbol for diversity, openness and equal rights, Fjällraven thinks it perfectly captures the spirit of outdoor life.
Kånken Rainbow celebrates every individual’s freedom to express herself, and for each backpack sold 1 % of proceeds is donated to projects within Fjällräven's Arctic Fox Initiative.
A special edition pack with all that great Kånken love, and a bit more.
Compression straps on the sides stabilise the pack when it is not fully loaded.

Rudy Project is committed to the highest safety standards by using integrated hinges and deformable plastics to minimise injuries from falling or impact.
This system can also be used to adjust the glasses’ height and their distance from the face to prevent misting.
The driving pleasure and the safety are strong arguments for a De Goya, but last but not least it impresses with a very aesthetic appearance of the add-on parts, a touch of nostalgia through the saddle and the handles as well as restrained understatement of the frame in plain black matt.
AXA LED lighting and smooth-running Schwalbe Marathon tires complete the perfect e-bike:
The efficient 250 watt motor offers optimum power development and propulsion on the mountain "without ifs or buts".

The Carapax 2.0 from Alpina is at home on the trails.
With the revised version of the successful model, you always make the right choice off-road.
Whether uphill or downhill.
It is an all-rounder in the off-road area and belongs to the lightest Enduro models on the market.
The Ergo Flex Run System ensures maximum comfort and safety.
The adaptation system impresses with its filigree construction and fixes the helmet evenly to the head 360 degrees around.
A bicycle helmet cannot be fitted more individually, smoothly or comfortably.
A further plus for comfort: the removable padding.
With it you always have a pleasant wearing feeling - no matter how wild it gets in the terrain.
The low weight of the Carapax 2.0 is due to the Inmold production, in which the upper shell is thermally connected to the Hi-EPS.
This results in a firm surface connection, which is responsible for a very stable construction.
The lower edge of the helmet is protected by the additional Edge Protect polycarbonate shell.
Thanks to the seamless connection, it nestles seamlessly to the top shell.

Airflow VentsOne factor that strongly influences the wearing comfort is the ventilation of the helmet.
HI-EPSThe inner shell of all Alpina helmets is made of Hi-EPS (High Expanded Polystyrol).
Hi-EPS provides optimum protection and at the same time enables extra-thin wall thicknesses and narrow helmet shapes. inmoldIn the Inmold production process, the polycarbonate helmet shell is thermally bonded to the Hi-EPS inner shell of the helmet body under great heat and pressure.
Ceramic ShellAll Alpina helmets manufactured using the Inmold process receive a robust Ceramic Shell.

The Ventral SPIN sets a new benchmark for aerodynamic performance.
Created with input from the Team EF Pro Cycling Team and our aero experts in WATTS Lab, and with extensive computational fluid dynamic simulation, the helmet’s design ensures it is the fastest helmet POC has so far produced.
Designed to lead air through rather than around the helmet and therefore improve aerodynamic properties, the Ventral SPIN has been inspired by the Venturi effect and is constructed so it can pass through the air with greater efficiency.
The helmet’s trailing edge reduces turbulence and improves linear airflow, supporting enhanced aerodynamic performance.
SPIN technologyOblique impact protection is necessary to counter the forces involved in non-linear impacts, which are a common cause of head injury.
Research has shown that compared to a direct, or linear, fall the force required to cause serious head injury from an oblique impact is often much lower.

Coolmax Coolmax is a registered trademark of ADVANSA, the European leader in polyester production.
However, Coolmax is a speciality among polyester fibres:
Its surface area is up to 25% larger than that of normal fibres, which means that the moisture generated by sweating on the body is removed much faster and better.
The capillary-like nature of the fibres results in a wicking effect that effectively transports moisture away.
The Coolmax system is known for its optimal moisture removal and its very good breathability.
Once the moisture has been transported to the outside, it evaporates, allowing the fabric to dry extremely quickly.
The properties can be summarized as follows: keeps cool, dry and comfortable, transports moisture away quickly, dries quickly, soft, light, breathable, machine washable.

Meticulous EvolutionThe Free Aero Race 4 Bibshort is Castellis top race short, which also means that it's insanely comfortable even if you never pin on a number.
The original Free Aero Race Bibshort was first introduced over a decade ago and has logged literally millions of kilometers under the backsides of Castellis sponsored pro riders and has been the best-selling short both in the Castelli retail collection and in their Servizio Corse custom program.
Over this time the short has undergone numerous updates and improvements in the never-ending quest to create the best short Castelli can make.
While the basic concept of a minimalist workhorse pro-level comfortable race short remains, every single fabric, component, stitch and construction method has been updated and improved over time.
The fourth major generation of the short features the updated Progetto X2 Air Seamless seat pad.
This pad separates a soft, stretchy skin care layer that moves with your body from a generously padded cushioning layer that replicates the form of your saddle.
Eight-hour rides are no problem.
Of course the fabrics are premium, made to Castellis specifications by Italy's best fabric suppliers.
The Forza fabric on the inner leg features 38% Lycra content for perfect fit, while the Vortex fabric on the side panels is dimpled for aerodynamics.
And it's held in place by the latest iteration of their seamless flat Giro leg gripper.
Doppio V construction at the front for more support and comfort

Like its big brother: the Carapax JR. is inspired by the model for adults and promises optimal protection in the terrain for all young mountain bikers.
The low weight, the maximum head cover and a long equipment list give it an optimal price/performance ratio.
The low weight is due to the Inmold production, where the upper shell is thermally connected to the Hi-EPS.
The lower edge of the helmet is protected by the further polycarbonate shell Edge Protect.
In addition, the tail and temples are pulled further down for maximum safety on rough trails.
Large ventilation openings ensure optimum ventilation, fly screens keep insects away from the head and the shield guarantees optimum protection in the visible area.
With the Run System Classic, which is combined with the height-adjustable Custom Fit, the bicycle helmet can be adapted to the head.
As an option, the Multi-Fit Light tail light can be retrofitted on the Carapax JR. for better visibility.
Run System CLASSICThe Run System allows the size of all Alpina helmets to be individually adjusted using a smooth-running rotating wheel.

In 2010 Castelli introduced the Gabba to the pros and changed the way pros race in the rain.
And cold.
And ride in training.
Every other performance cyclist soon saw the need for a Gabba in his or her wardrobe.
Castelli made some minor updates along the way, but for the fourth-generation Gabba they started with a clean slate to make a significant upgrade.
That involved moving it to near waterproof levels, which meant developing a new exclusive GORE-TEX INFINIUM WINDSTOPPER fabric.
Castelli made the front-facing fabric warmer with a light brushing, while the rear-facing fabrics are lighter yet more water repellent than the previous Gabba.
They made it better in the rain through seam sealing on the shoulders and a covered zipper.
Based on Team INEOS testing, Castelli figured it's better to have two pockets that are easier to access with gloved hands, though they provide an internal sleeve to keep your pump or other items from moving around.

The adjustable breakaway peak works to enhance safety in a crash, as it reduces forces transmitted to the neck.
Size-specific weight:
Including a 360° size adjustment system that makes it easy to find a precise fit, the helmet features a fully wrapped unibody shell for improved structural integrity.
The EVOC STAGE 6l is a technical bike backpack with extensive features - the ideal choice for short enduro laps or bikepark use.
The BRACE LINK allows the freely movable straps to provide maximum freedom of movement on the bike.
AIR FLOW CONTACT SYSTEMThe aim here is to transfer the load as neutrally as possible to the body's centre of gravity and at the same time minimise the contact surfaces on the back.
We solve this contradiction with a back section in which the ventilation components such as large ventilation channels and specially milled and perforated EVA pads are laid inwards behind a mesh fabric.
This achieves a fit that stays close to the back and at the same time optimises ventilation.
Air CirculationAir Circulation is used in all our backpacks, as it ensures optimal ventilation even during high exertion and sweating and simultaneously prevents the sensitive kidney area from getting cold.
A continuous, free air circulation is ensured by the vertically guided air duct.
Additional air can flow off via lateral recesses along the canal.
In addition, the upholstery in the lateral back areas has been reduced to further optimise air flow.
Brace LinkThe BRACE LINK allows the straps to be optimally adjusted to the shoulder width of the athlete.
Flexible alignment supports load distribution to the body's center of gravity while minimising back and shoulder contact.
The BRACE LINK also makes it possible to wear a neck brace.
3D AIR MESHThis three-dimensional structured fabric with different thread thicknesses (P75D*30D) offers optimal ventilation and padding properties for back sections and shoulder straps.
AIR MESHAir Mesh is equipped with pore-like penetrations that allow optimum air circulation.
However, the fine structure prevents the absorption of moisture.
This feature makes it the perfect upper material for the backs of Evoc's backpacks.
N210 D RIPSTOP PU COATEDThe requirements for the perfect outer material for backpacks can be summarised in four properties: durable, abrasion-resistant, water-repellent and lightweight.
A quadruple PU coating of the lightweight nylon base material provides moisture protection and abrasion resistance.
P600 D PU coatedA very robust fabric for areas subject to high wear.
P600 D PU coatedA very robust fabric for areas subject to high wear.
In addition, it is tearproof and light and absorbs almost no moisture.
Combining these properties it’s the optimal material for highly stressed bags or the bottoms of bags and backpacks.

The proven Alpina fit ensures that the bicycle helmet fits perfectly, does not slip, and does not pinch.
Airflow ventingOne factor that strongly influences the wearing comfort is the ventilation of the helmet.
Ceramic ShellAll helmets from Alpina, which are manufactured using the Inmold process, are equipped with a robust ceramic shell.
Ceramic ShellAll helmets from Alpina, which are manufactured using the Inmold process, are equipped with a robust ceramic shell.
A polycarbonate plate is stretched under high heat onto the shape of the future helmet and pressed with high pressure onto the Hi-EPS body and thermally bonded to it.
It is break and scratch resistant, UV-stable and antistatic.
Hi-EPSThe inner shell of all Alpina helmets is made of Hi-EPS (High Expanded Polystyrene).
The material has microscopically small air chambers which absorb the forces that act on the helmet during an impact.
Hi-EPS provides optimum protection and at the same time allows extra-thin wall thicknesses and narrow helmet shapes.
Inmold TechnologyIn the Inmold production process, the helmet upper shell made of polycarbonate is thermally bonded to the Hi-EPS inner shell of the helmet body under great heat and strong pressure.
ErgomaticProven hundreds of thousands of times and used in all Alpina helmets: the belt buckle with the red push button and multi-stage automatic lock.
Ergomatic can be operated with one hand - uphill you can loosen the strap, downhill you can tighten it - and in the event of a fall, the buckle mechanism cannot open by itself.
Y-ClipA helmet can only provide the best possible protection if it remains in the optimum position in the event of a collision.
The adjustment and fixing of the two straps under the ear plays a decisive role in this.
The Y-clip system guarantees an adjustment accurate to the millimetre - in seconds.
Thanks to Hi-EPS, a perfect fit and the Inmold construction, the Haga provides optimum protection in the event of an impact.
The head is thus always pleasantly air-conditioned.
Y clip
This positioning means that the wearer is seen earlier by other road users.
The air is purposefully directed into the interior, where it is guided along the head and can flow out again at the rear.
The bike helmet is made for sporty commuters and urban cyclists with high demands on their own style and safety.
The dynamically designed helmet stays not only create a light and modern urban look, but also ensure that the head is optimally ventilated.
The Haga combines these characteristics.
An integral rear light is positioned so that it is clearly visible even from the side.
This ensures a cool head, safe decisions in traffic and maximum comfort.
The Haga is the new urban helmet from Alpina: sporty, dynamic and at the same time reduced, clean.
Narrow, simple, good.
The modern full-frame glasses Defey are especially suitable for slim faces.
The range of use, however, is wide:
